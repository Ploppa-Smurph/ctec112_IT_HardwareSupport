    <pre><h2>01 Course Intro</h2>
        <h3>1.1.2 Computer Basics</h3>
        As a technician it is important to know the components: Hardware and Software. Software gives the 
        computer it's instructions. Hardware is the 'potential' and Software is the 'instruction'.
    
        Input Devices - Keyboard, Mouse, Touch or Pen Display
           resistive touchscreen - 2 layers in the touch screen -- kiosk
           capacitive touchscreen - have a coating that interprets a 'conductive' touch -- difficult to use with gloves -- common on tablets and phones
    
        Processing Devices - CPU, 
        
        Storage Devices - RAM (is a storage device, even if it is volitile, short term storage), Long Term Storage Devices, HDD, SD

        Output Devices - Monitor (most common), Printer, Sound Card & Speakers
        
        Networking Devices - allow multiple computers to communicate -- networking devices are both input and output

        Modular Design hardware -- monitors, keyboards and mouses are all modular now and can be used on almost any computer system

        Input, Processing, Storage, Output, Networking

        <h3>1.1.3 Computing Facts</h3>
        Hardware	The physical components that compose a computer system or network. Common hardware components include:
                    -Keyboard, mouse, monitor, and printer.
                    -Connectors and cables.
                    -Hard disk drives.
                    -Circuit boards.
        Software	Instructions or data that are stored electronically, either on a hard drive or a special chip. Software components include:
                    -Operating systems.
                    -Program applications.
                    -Hardware drivers (special programs that tell the operating system how to use the hardware).

        Componentization-	A functional PC is a combination of parts. Each part is considered a field-replaceable unit (FRU), meaning it can be quickly replaced when faulty or easily upgraded when needed. Componentization keeps maintenance costs low and reduces downtime.
        
        Standardization-	Specifications allow components from different manufacturers to be interchangeable. If a component meets the specified standards, it will work in the computer regardless of manufacturer.

        <h3>2.1.1 Safety</h3>
        Remove Jewelry when working with electrical items.

        Make certain the 'Grounding Pin' is correctly connected in the plug. A/C current is between 110-120 Volts at 60 cycles / second

        Remove the Battery from laptops when working on them intarnally. 

        Capacitors in the Power Supply can take seconds to discharge their power (hence the unplug and wait 30 seconds before replugging).

        **NEVER** wear an ESD Wrist Strap around High Voltage!!

        Heat Sinks and Heat Spreaders get HOT -- keep your wires organized.

        <h3>2.1.2 Safety Measures</h3>
        Power -	Power hazards can cause electrical shock and burns.

        --Before handling a system component, make sure that it is powered off and that the main power cord is unplugged from the wall socket.
        --Ensure that the grounding pin on a PC power plug is intact.
        --Unplug the system before working on internal components. Newer power supplies constantly pull power from the socket.
        --Be aware that the power inverter (power supply) converts AC to DC. Also be aware that the power supply can retain an electrical charge, even when it's not plugged in. Replace faulty power supplies instead of trying to repair them.
        --Avoid opening the power supply, which houses a capacitor (stores a large charge of electricity).

        Capacitor -	A capacitor is a device that stores an electric charge. Be sure to discharge capacitors or turn the equipment over to qualified personnel for servicing. Similarly, exercise caution when working with the DC converter in a laptop display.

        ESD and high voltage - Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is the flow of electricity from one electrically charged object to another. While some ESD can be unnoticeable to the human senses, it can still be hazardous to computer components.
        Take the following precautions when handling electronics:

        --Use ESD wrist straps not only to protect components, but to reduce the chance of accidental electrical shock. Properly ground yourself before working with components.
        --Do not use an ESD wrist strap when working with monitors, power supplies, laptop LCD panels, or other high-voltage components.
        --Exercise caution when wearing jewelry, because it readily conducts electricity and could cause burns or even electrocution.

        Peripherals - A peripheral is a device that connects to a computer, such as a monitor or a printer. Peripherals can present a safety hazard to you.
        
        --Do not use a regular multimeter or other electrical testing equipment to measure charge inside a monitor.
        --Never clean the monitor's glass with a liquid solvent while the monitor is powered on.
        --Some studies suggest that laser printers emit tiny particles which could be dangerous when inhaled. As a precaution, do not locate laser printers immediately next to desks, and keep the area ventilated.
        --Avoid handling leaky batteries. The leaking electrolytes can be harmful if they get into your eyes.
        --Never look into the end of a fiber optic networking cable. Laser light can damage your eyes.

        <h3>2.1.3 Electrostatic Discharge</h3>
        ESD is your worst enemy -- you don't want items becoming positively or negatively charged (stealing electrons).

        RAM and CPUs can be destroyed by small shocks of 100 volts or less.

        Prevent ESD -- discharge yourself first - touch the caseframe first, use a static mat, a static floor mat or static flooring
                        don't touch the silver or gold leads from the memory or any expansion cards. -- use your static shielding bags when storing parts
                          -- pink and blue bags are static resistant, but not static shielded and are not as safe as static shielded bags
        <h3>2.1.4 ESD Protection</h3>
        Preventing ESD when working on a PC. use Static Mats ground the mat to the case, then ground yourself with a strap. always UNPLUG the PSU before working on a system. 
        <h3>2.1.5 ESD Facts</h3>
        ESD Safety Measures

            Implement the following measures to defend components from ESD:

                -Keep the relative humidity in the room at an ideal range of 35-70%, and temperature between 72-77 degrees. The key is to avoid dry air in the computer repair location to prevent ESD.
                -Use antistatic mats under the PC and on the floor.
                -Discharge yourself before touching any computer component.
                -When touching anything inside the computer, wear an antistatic wrist strap that is attached to the metal PC chassis with an alligator clip.
                -Ground both yourself and the computer to the same ground. This provides a single path for the flow of electrical potential.
                -Use static-resistant materials to handle computer components.
                -Never touch the metal connectors on a circuit board.
                -Keep the computer repair location free of materials that accumulate electric charges, such as plastic and Styrofoam.
                -Store sensitive components in static shielding bags, which are usually grey. Static-resistant bags are not nearly as effective. They are usually tinted pink or blue.
                -Unplug the system before working on internal components. Do not rely on the power cord for an electrical ground.
        <h2>2.5 PC Maintenance</h2>
        Interference - A signal that corrupts or destroys regular signals. Interference affects signals used by two devices to communicate on a network.

        Electromagnetic interference(EMI) - Interference that affects wired network signals.

        Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning(HVAC) - The system installed within buildings to control temperature by supplying heat and air conditioning.

        Radio frequency interference(RFI) -	Signals caused by cordless phones, microwave ovens, and wireless devices that interfere with wireless networking.
        <h2>2.6 PC and Networking Tools</h2>
        physical tools of the trade -- crimper, cable stripper, WiFi analyzer, Toner probe, Punchdown tool, Cable tester, Loopback plug, Network tap
        <h3>2.6.1 Tools</h3>
        ESD Wrist Strap often used with a mat, screwdriver, plier, extension magnet (be careful), 3 prong holder (IC Tool), multi-meter with volt-meter, resistance, and current flow
                Tone Generator and probe (find RJ-45 cables), Cable Tester -- can be very inexpensive, or very complex and expensive like a TDR (Time Domain Reflectometer)
                Optical Fiber has an Optical TDR, Use Loopback plugs, must have Known Good Spare Network equipment on hand (PSU, Fans, Cables, Memory) 

                POST Card - Power On Self Test Card that plugs into expansion slot on MoBo and displays output of BIOS 
        <h2>2.7 Troubleshooting Process</h2>
        Always consider corporate policies, procedures, and impacts before implementing changes
            -Identify the problem
            -Gather information from the user, identify user changes, and, if applicable, perform backups before making changes
            -Inquire regarding environmental or infrastructure changes
            -Establish a theory of probable cause (question the obvious)
            -If necessary, conduct external or internal research based on symptoms
            -Test the theory to determine the cause
            -Once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve the problem
            -If the theory is not confirmed, re-establish a new theory or escalate
            -Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution
            -Refer to the vendor's instructions for guidance
            -Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures
            -Document the findings, actions, and outcomes
        <h3>2.7.1 Troubleshooting Process</h3>
        the Systematic Troubleshooting Process 
        - Gather Information -- try to get the user to recreate the problem. determine if it is a localized problem.
        - Identify changes
        - Backup user data
        - Establish a Theory -- check all power cords and cables
        - Test your Theory
        - Create an Action Plan - consider the consequences, Acquire approval, Notify impacted parties, Use vendor documentation
        - Test Solution and Ensure Satisfaction 
        - Document Problem and Resolution
        <h3>2.7.2 Troubleshooting Process Facts</h3>        
        ** Often, the hardest part of troubleshooting is to reproduce the problem. You might need to ask the user questions to identify exactly how the problem occurred, or you might need to watch them perform the task again to reproduce the problem.
            --If a hardware device or a software program causes a specific error, check the manufacturer's website for additional help in troubleshooting the error.
            --To help diagnose issues, you can run special software tools supplied by the hardware manufacturer.
            --In addition to a basic toolkit, you can keep a few spare parts on hand that you know to be in working order. If you suspect that a component has failed, replace it with the known good spare. If that solves the problem, replace the faulty component.
            --Intermittent problems are difficult to troubleshoot. Check for environmental conditions such as kinked cables or overheated components.
            --If you have problems identifying a hardware error, you can simplify the system by removing all but necessary components (processor, memory, and hard disk). Add devices one at a time and restart the system. If an error occurs, remove the newly added device and troubleshoot that device. Another strategy would be to remove a single device and restart the system, seeing if removing that device corrects the problem.
            --Some problems might be caused by software errors, not hardware failures. You might need to begin by updating the drivers or unloading software.
            --Before you make changes, always consider corporate policies and procedures and the changes' impact on other people and components.
