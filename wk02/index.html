            <h3>3.1.1 Netowrk Cables</h3>
            the network media is either 'Bound' or 'Unbound'. Bound media is contained in some sort of cable. 
                <b>Coaxial</b> - solid wire inner conductor, pvc Insulator, braided mesh, plastic pvc sheath -- this is a standard makeup, but they can be different styles
                    RG-59: is the general coaxial cable (used for tv)
                    RG-6:  has higher quality signal, replaces to RG-59
                        F-Type connector: is the standard coaxial connector end, screws onto the plate
                        BNC connector: is used in old networks (that old plug from the office video monitor my dad gave me when I was young).
                    Coaxial cable is resistant to EMI and Durable; but it is expensive to run over long areas and splitters cut signal strength in half.
                <b>Twisted Pair</b> - most common for networking. 8 copper wires twisted into 4 pairs. reduces EMI Crosstalk since they are twisted together as a pair.
                         UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) - cheap, but does not protect against external EMI
                         STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) - each wire pair is wrapped in shielding to prevent EMI (Electro Magnetic Interferance)
                     Cat-5 (100Mpbs, 100MHz); Cat-5e (1Gpbs, 100MHz) {gigabit ethernet} 
                     Cat-6 (1 Gpbs, 250MHz); Cat-6a (10Gpbs, 500 MHz)
                     Cat-7 (10 Gpbs, 600MHz) - Requires Shielded Twisted Pair
                     Cat-8 (40 Gpbs, 2000 MHz) - requires Shielded Twisted Pair {alternate to Fiber Optic (still not as fast as Fiber Optic)}  
                        RJ-45 - basic connector for twisted pair - clear plastic with clip (8 pins)
                        RJ-11 - smaller than RJ-11 -- common Telephone cable connection (4 pins)
                    Twisted Pair cable is cheap per foot and flexible; susceptible to EMI and they are not as secure
                <b>Fiber Optic</b> - light pulses, not Electric Signal. Central Core with Cladding (cladding helps reproject light signal back to the central core), Protective Layer, surrounded by plastic sheath            
                        SMF (Single-Mode Fiber): smaller core allows for longer cable lenght, extremely fast speeds
                        MMF (Multi-Mode Fiber): larger internal core allows multiple data channels, must have a shorter cable or the signal difuses
                    Fiber Optic is Immune to EMI, and can have the longest cable length; Fiber Optic is very expensive and the cable is inflexible and can break -- must have special training to install the connector.  
                <b>Plenum Rated Cabling</b> - has fire shielding and can be run above dropped down ceilings and in crawl spaces

        <h3>3.3.7 Install Mobo Facts</h3>
            Repairing a motherboard is beyond the skill of most technicians. It is almost always cheaper and faster to purchase a new one than to replace the old one.
               
        1) Document the current CMOS settings when you replace an existing motherboard. You might need these settings to configure the new motherboard.
        2) Install the CPU, heat sink, and memory before installing the motherboard in the case.
        3) Insert the I/O shield into the case.
        4) Fasten standoffs to the case. Be sure to match the hole pattern on the motherboard. The standoffs prevent the motherboard circuits from touching the system case.
        5) Install the motherboard, securing it to the standoffs with insulated washers and screws.
        6) Connect the power and accessory cables:
        7) Connect the ATX power cable and the CPU power cable.
        8) Connect the CPU fan power cable.
        9) Connect case wires (e.g., power switch, reset switch, drive activity lights, and power lights).
        10) Connect any case fan cables.
        11) Connect drives to SATA connectors.
        12) Install additional devices in expansion slots.
        13) Connect wires for front/top panel ports (e.g., USB, audio, or eSATA).
        14) Document the settings of the new motherboard.

         <h3>3.4.1 Motherboard Troubleshooting</h3>
         Power Supply Issue -  Pin 8 on the PSU supplies power to the mother board. a bad psu can cause failure to power on, or reboot loops.
         POST (Power On Self Test) Error Messages - beeps or screen error messages.  
            POST card shows post readout to small screen
         Overheating caused by poor airflow, being too hot in the room, dust buildup inside the unit
         Temperature Monitoring -- many mobos have thermal shutdown feature.
         Internal Device Failure -- replace devices that are failing, always check any device drivers first.
         If you see or smell smoke then shutdown the unit immediately. usually too late to fix -- unlikely the components will work correctly again.


        <h2>3.5 Memory</h2>
        DDR-	Five generations of RAM synchronized with the system clock including DDR1 through DDR5. Each new generation doubles the data transfer rate.
        DRAM-	A type of RAM that stores data using a single transistor for every bit of data.
        SODIMM-	A smaller memory card with unique notch positions that is used in laptops and notebook computers.
        SRAM-	A type of RAM that stores data using four transistors for every bit of data.
        <h3>3.5.1 DRAM Types</h3>
            <b>DDR (double data rate)</b>
                -- DRAM is Dynamic Random Access Memory - process one command per clock cycle (64-bits of data = 1 Word)
                DRAM will show up as a square wave on an oscilliscope
                DDRAM doubles the data processed per clock cycle - DDRAM Double Pumps (it reads the data on the up and downside of its clock cycle, doubling it's speed)
            <b>MTS / DDR Rating</b> = Mega Transfers / Second  
            <b>MHz</b> = base bus speed of the RAM
              the MTS (DDR Rating) is the base bus of the RAM doubled  [ex: DDR266 has a bus speed of 133MHz] 
            <b>PC Rating</b> = Data processing speed in Mbps.
                  RAM data is processed in 64-bit(8-byte) words, so to calculate the PC Rating you multiply the DDR rating by 8
                    [ex: DDR-266 = 133MHz and is PC-2100 (2128 rounded up or down for marketing purposes) ]
                DDR -- 180 pins
                DDR2 -- 240 pins, notch is closer to the middle
                DDR3 - 240 pins, notch is to the left of DDR2
                DDR4 - up to 64GB, 288 pins, notch is in the center
                DDR5 - increased efficiency and lower latency, up to 64GB, notch to the left, 288 pins
            <b>DIMM</b> - any variation of DDR 
            <b>SO-DIMM</b> - used in laptops
            <b>UniDIMM</b> - can have DDR3 or DDR4 in the same slots

            <b>Multi-Channel Memory</b> - only a 5%-15% increase - specific to motherboard, Mobo has multiple memory processors for RAM

            <b>ECC Memory</b> - data correcting, used by banks and financial institutions, not in average PC
        <h3>3.5.3 Multi-Channel Memory Architecture Facts</h3>
            
              Memory 	Bus Frequency	DDR Rating (MT/s)	PC Rating (in MB)	Voltage
                DDR	    133 – 200 MHz	     266 – 400 MT/s	     PC2100 – PC3200	2.5 volts
                DDR2	266 – 400 MHz	     533 – 800 MT/s	     PC4200 – PC6400	1.8 volts
                DDR3	533 – 800 MHz	    1066 – 1600 MT/s	 PC8500 - PC14900	1.5 volts
                DDR4	1066 – 1600 MHz	    2133 – 3200 MT/s	PC12800 – PC25600	1.2 volts
                DDR5	2133 – 3200 MHz	    3200 – 6400 MT/s	PC38400 – PC51200	1.1 volts
        <h2>3.6 Memory Installation</h2>
            Buffered memory-	A space in memory that holds memory addresses or data before it is transferred to the memory controller. It is also called registered memory.
            Capacity-	A term that refers to the storage capacity of the memory module.
            Error correcting code-	A type of memory that detects and corrects common internal data corruption. It is also called parity memory.
            Frequency-	Memory frequency (called speed) should be supported by the system bus/memory controller.
        <h3>3.6.1 Memory Characteristics</h3>
        1) Determine type of memory supported by Motherboard (check documentation or online support) -- good source is Crucial.com's Memory Scanner tool
        2) Check the exisiting RAM module - check notch and pin density
        3) Determine DDR memory to use [ex: DDR2, DDR3]
        4) Determine Maximum amount of memory -- 32bit board only supports 4GB; Windows Server systems can use PAE (Physical Memory) to extend the memory allowed on a 32bit system.
                64-bit systems can theoretically have 16 Exobytes of memory. Now 1-2TB is the most you will most likely see - 16GB+ of memory in home PCs
        5) Verify that the memory speed is supported by the mobo. 
        6) Does the mobo require ECC Memory (Error Correcting)? usually in high end servers -- has an extra chip on the memory stick that checks for errors (normally 9 chips on the stick vs 8 chips on normal memory)
                ECC memory will reduce the performance of a system by 2%
        7) Registered Memory / Buffered Memory - used in high end systems not the same, but still used interchangebly -- has an extra chip in the middle of memory stick, the extra chip serves as a buffer.
                    registered memory is much more expensive than normal memory.
        8) Column Address Strobe Latency (CL) - specifies response time delay, measured in clock cycles -- LOWER THE BETTER
        9) Timing Parameters - Four Parameters in clock cycles [ex: 5-5-515]
                    - CL: CAS Latency is 1st 5
                    - tRCD: Row to Column Address is the 2nd (determines how many cycles it takes to open and access a row of memory)              
                    - tRP: Row Precharge Time (cycles from issuing of the command to opening of the next row)
                    - tRAS: Row Active Time (amount of clock cycles from the tRCD to the issuing of the tRP )
        10) Serial Presence Detect (SPD) - stored on an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) - located on the SDRAM module
                contains the Module size, Data width, Speed, Voltage -- can overclock and underclock the SPD           
        <h3>3.6.4 Select Correct Memory Module</h3>
                go to control panel -> System -> shows the ram that is currently installed. 
                
            <b>WMIC</b> -- start elevated command prompt (run as admin) and:
                    >wmic baseboard get product,manufacturer,version

            <b>Speccy</b> - 3rd party software that determines specs
            <b>Memory Configurator</b> - Crucial Advisor Tool (or similar tool), Crucial System Scanner analyzes the system and tells you the options for upgrades
        <h3>3.6.5 Install Memory</h3> 
    <h2>3.7 Memory Troubleshooting</h2>   
        <h3>3.7.1</h3>
