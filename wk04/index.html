    <h2>5.1 Storage Devices</h2>
    Flash memory-	Electronic non-volatile memory that is easy to erase and reprogram.
    Hard disk-	A long-term storage device that uses a thick magnetic disk made of several aluminum platters in a protective shell.
    Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE)-	An electronic interface that allows communication between a motherboard's data paths or bus and a computer's hard disks.
    Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe)-	A memory storage device designed to allow access to non-volatile storage media through a PCI express (PCIe) bus.
    Optical disc- storage device that records binary information through pits in a reflectively-coated disc. Optical discs use lasers for reading and writing information.
    M.2-	A popular solid-state drive often used in portable computing devices.
    SD card-	A flash memory device is often used in digital cameras.
    Solid-state drive (SSD)-  A flash device with a large storage capacity comparable to a hard disk.
    <h3>5.1.1 Storage Devices Video</h3>
        HDD - read write heads - magnetic platters 
        IDE - Integrated Drive Electronics - allows communication between bus and hdd
        SSD - Solid State - Flash Memory instead of platters - reads and writes faster. smaller and lighter - no mechanical parts
          M.2 - for internally mounted SSD drive
          NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) - works on PCIe slot? - made for accessing non-volatile storage media through a PCI Express bus.
        Flash Drive - non-volatile 
        Optical Drive - Blu-Ray, DVD, and CD
    <h3>5.1.2 Facts</h3>
    <h2>5.2 SATA</h2>
    Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA)-	The latest generation of standards for hard disk and other storage devices.
    External SATA (eSATA)-	An extension to the SATA standard that enables SATA drives to attach externally.
    <h3>5.2.1 SATA video</h3>
        Serial Advanced Technology Attachment - SATA = point to point connection 
                serial / bus architecture (each cable has a transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) wires)
        has L pin to keep from being plugged in incorrectly
                SATA i - 1.5Gbs
                SATA ii - 3Gbs
                SATA iii - 6Gbs
        eSATA - External SATA - typically faster than usb or firewire -- needs external power 
        eSATAp = eSATA with power -- doesn't need power 
    <h3>5.2.2 SATA Facts</h3>                  
        SATA devices use a special 15-pin power connector that supplies 3.3, 5, and 12 volts. You can use an adapter cable to convert a 4-pin Molex connector to a SATA power connector, but if you do, the resulting cable will not have 3.3 volts (3.3 volts are typically not used in most SATA devices).
    <h2>5.3 Optical Media</h2>
    Optical drive-	A disc drive that uses laser light or electromagnetic waves within or near the visible light spectrum as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs.
    Optical media-	A flat, circular disc used to store large amounts of data.
    Compact disc (CD)-	A digital optical disc data storage format with a data capacity of 700 MB.
    Digital versatile disc (DVD)-	An optical media standard that can be used to store large amounts of different types of data, such as computer data, video, and audio. Most DVD drives can read and write. Depending on the type of DVD, storage is typically somewhere between 4.7 and 9.39 GB.
    Blu-ray disc (BD)-	A newer digital optical disc storage format that is capable of greater storage capacity than DVDs.
    <h3>5.3.1</h3>
        Pit - Doesnt' Reflect 
        Land - Does Reflect
    <h3>5.3.3 Blu-ray</h3>    
        CD and DVD use Red Laser, but Blu-ray uses a Blue Laser!!
    <h2>5.4 RAID</h2>
    RAID-	A disk sub-system that combines multiple physical disks into a single logical storage unit.
    Just a Bunch of Disks(JBOD)-	A configuration that places multiple disks in a single logical storage unit.
    <h3>5.4.1 RAID</h3>
    <h2>5.7 Storage Spaces</h2>
    <h3>5.7.1</h3>
    <h2>5.8 Disk Optimization</h2>
    <h3>5.8.1</h3>
    <h2>5.9 Storage and RAID Troubleshooting</h2>
