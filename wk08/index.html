<h2>11.1 Networking Overview</h2>
Network-	A group of interconnected computers and devices that can share information information with each other
Subnet- 	A portion of a network with a common network address.
Nodes or hosts- 	Devices that reside on the network. Hosts can range from a computer, tablet, mobile phone, gaming console, IoT device, or server.
Transmission media- 	The medium that is used to carry electrical or radio signals between connected network hosts.
Network Interfaces- 	Converts the digital network data into a signal that can be transmitted along the transmission medium.
Protocols-  	Rules or standards that describe how hosts communicates and exchange data.
Peer-to-peer- 	Network in which hosts can both share and access data.
Client-server-   Network in which hosts have specific roles.
Storage Attached Network (SAN)-  	A special type of network that provides high-speed access to storage across the network. Specialized hardware is used to store and provide access to needed data.
Body Area Network (BAN)- 	A very small network that consists of wearable or implanted devices such as a smart watch, fitness trackers, or medical implants.
Personal Area Network (PAN)- 	A small network for communication between personal devices such as wireless earbuds and a cell phone.
Local Area Network (LAN)-  	A network in a small geographic area, like an office. A LAN typically uses wires to connect systems together.
Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)-	  Same as LAN but uses wireless connection.
Campus Area Network (CAN)-   Sometimes referred to as a corporate area network, this network type is established when multiple LANs are connected together within a limited area, such as a college campus or between multiple buildings that are owned by the same organization.
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)-   A network that covers an area as small as a few city blocks to as large as an entire metropolitan city.
Wide Area Network (WAN)- 	Group of LANs that are geographically isolated but are connected to form a large internetwork.

Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)-  	Similar to WLAN but uses different technology to connect to the internet. Also known as 4G, 5G, or LTE networks.
Internetwork-	 A network with geographically disperse connections that connect multiple LANs.
Internet- 	Large, world-wide, public network.
Intranet- 	Private network that uses internet technologies.
Extranet-	Private network that uses internet technologies but its resources are made available to trusted external users.
    <h3>11.1.1 Networking Introduction</h3>
        networks are interconnected computers sharing data -- the internet is the worlds largest network
    
    Components on the network: ex: computer; tablet; mobile; laptop; game system; & thermostat   
        cabling, fiber optics, or wireless radio signals
    
    switch = central connection point

    wap wireless access point = 

    router = connects multiple networks together

    each device has a unique identifier - the network id & host id 
       written out as IP address
          each part of the address is 1 octet
      find out info with the subnet mask = 255.0.0.0 /8
                                           255.255.0.0 /16
                                           255.255.255.0 /24    

    ip address - network portion comes first; last part is host portion 
                ex: 192.168.0.50
                    255.255.0.0
             
     in the above ex: 255 in the subnet = network ID  [192.168] is the network portion of the ip address
                      0 in the subnet = Host ID    [0.50] is the host id part of the ip address                    

    sharing resources is; ie: network printer or file storage
<h3>11.1.2 Network Types</h3>
need to know the role of each device in our system:

server & client 

Peer-to-Peer = client & server (workgroups) 
            - easy to implement
            - relatively inexpensive
            - use existing hosts
            - no special software

    cons of peer-to-peer: 
            - not scalable
            - no centralized control
            - no central file storage
            - fewer safeguards for data      

Client-Server network model
        set up server for files
                      for email
                      for printer  
                      
        and clients use the information stored centrally on the server
        
    user accounts, sharing permissions, and network management are all handled by the client?

server runs server OS that only runs server tasks. 
  clients run os for every day work task, desktop apps, has special client software to network with the server

  client-server cons: requires more planning
                        - more cost

BAN Body-A-Network 
PAN Personal Area Network
LAN Local Area Network 
WLAN Wireless LAN
CAN or Campus Area Network or Corporate Area Network
MAN Metropolitan Area Network joins multiple CANs across one metropolitan area
WAN Wide Area Network Connects LAN between cities
SAN Storage Attached Network -- provides great data protection
<h3>11.1.3 Networking Facts</h3> 
-Devices - Devices can include a computer, tablet, mobile phone, gaming console, IoT device, and server. The devices are typically referred to as network nodes or hosts.
-Transmission medium - The transmission medium connects network devices. Examples include twisted pair cabling, fiber optics, and wireless radio signals.
-Network interface (NIC) - The network interface converts the digital data into a signal that can be transmitted along the transmission medium.
-Specialized devices are used to connect host devices together. These connection devices include:
    -Routers to connect multiple networks together.
    -Switches to connect multiple computers inside of a network together.
    -Access point to connect wireless network hosts.
-Networking protocols - These are standards that define how data is formatted and how the network hosts will talk to each other.

<i>'Every device on a network requires a unique address. The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) formats the unique address using four octets that are each separated by a period. The IPv4 address is split into two components:

    The network ID defines the network address. Every host on the device has the same network ID.
    The host ID is a unique value that is different for each device.
    The subnet mask defines the octets that belong to the network ID and the octets that belong to the host ID. The standard subnet mask consists of four octets that match to each octet in the IPv4 address. Each octet in the subnet mask consists of two values, usually 255 or 0, but not always. Octets with 255 represent the network ID and 0â€™s represents the host ID. For example:
    
    The IP address 192.168.0.5 with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 shows that the first two octets in the IP address are the network ID and the last two octets are the host ID.
    Often, a large network is split into smaller networks called subnets. The subnet mask defines which network a host belongs to. Two devices need to be on the same subnet to communicate. If they are on different subnets, the traffic has to be sent through a router which will forward it onto the other network.'</i>

Wireless mesh network (WMN)-	A wireless mesh network is a group of wireless mesh nodes that communicate with one another to share the network connection across a large area.

    -WMNs provide the ability to stream voice, data, and video between arbitrary pairs of devices. Each device in the WMN uses the other devices in the WMN as relays to avoid the need for infrastructure.
    
Wireless wide area network (WWAN)-	A wireless wide area network covers a large geographical area by connecting separate areas wirelessly. WLAN and WWAN both connect to the internet wirelessly, but they use different technologies to do it.
    WWANs are often referred to as 4G, 5G, or LTE networks because they usually use cellular network technologies as connection types.

Subnet-	  A subnet is a portion of a network. All devices on the subnet share a common network address.
    -All devices on the subnet share the same network address, but each has a unique host address.
    -Each subnet in a larger network has a unique subnet address.
    -Devices connected through hubs or switches are on the same subnet. Routers are used to connect multiple subnets.    

Internet-	The internet is a large, world-wide, public network. The network is public because virtually anyone can connect to it. Users or organizations make services freely available on the internet.
    -Users and organizations connect to the internet through an internet service provider (ISP).
    -The internet uses a set of communication protocols (TCP/IP) for providing services.
    -Individuals and organizations can make services (such as a website) available to other users on the internet.
    
Intranet-	An intranet is a private network that uses internet technologies. Services on an intranet are available only to hosts that are connected to the private network.
    -For example, a company might have a website that only employees can access.
    
Extranet-	An extranet is a private network that uses internet technologies and makes its resources are made available to external trusted users.
    -For example, you might create a website on a private network that only users from a partner company can access.      

    -Personal Area Network (PAN): a very small network used for communication between personal devices. For example, a PAN may include a notebook computer, a wireless headset, a wireless printer, and a smartphone. A PAN's range is limited to only a few feet.
    -Local Area Network (LAN): a network in a small geographic area, like an office. A LAN typically uses wires to connect systems together. For example, a LAN is usually a set of subnets connected to each other using routers to connect the subnets.
    -Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN): a network that covers an area that is roughly the same size as a standard LAN. However, it uses radio signals instead of wires to connect systems together.
    -Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): a network that covers an area as small as a few city blocks to as large as an entire metropolitan city. MANs are typically owned and managed by a city as a public utility.
    -Wide Area Network (WAN): a group of LANs that are geographically isolated, but are connected to form a large internetwork.    

    The network interface (NIC) converts the digital data into a signal that can be transmitted along the transmission medium.

    Devices are connected together using a transmission medium. Examples include twisted pair cabling, fiber optics, or wireless radio signals. They do not convert the data into a digital signal.
    
    Switches are used to connect multiple computers inside of a network together. They do not convert the data into a digital signal.
    
    The network protocols define how data is formatted and how the network hosts will talk to each other. They do not convert the data into a digital signal.    
<h2>11.2 Networking Ports & Protocols</h2>
TCP-	A connection-oriented protocol. This means that when data is sent between two hosts, the TCP protocol ensures that every packet sent is received before sending the next packet.
UDP-	A connectionless protocol. Instead of verifying that each packet sent is received, UDP sends the packets one at time and the receiver processes them as they come in.
Port-	A part of a computing device that can connect to peripherals or cables. A computer port is like a door into the system. There are 65,536 possible network ports. The port number tells the host device the type of traffic sent and where to send it to.
3-way handshake-	The process two devices go through to establish a TCP connection.
<h3>11.2.1 TCP and UDP</h3>

packet and packet header --- breaks large bits into packets sort them by their headers

    TCP Transfer Control Protocol --  connection oriented - when data is sent, host verfies all data is received. 
      **aside: https & ssh are both connection oriented protocols 
    
    3 way handshake: SYN is sent to start; SYN + ACK is sent to acknowledge; ACK is sent to confirm and begin transmission: 
        for TCP with each data packet sent an ACK packet is sent from the client to acknowledge receipt
    
    TCP is normally used in a suite with the IP Internet Protocol... TCP/IP
        send data across internet: IP handles delivering data
                                   TCP handles segments and sequences

    UDP is connectionless - great for video and audio streaming -- very low latency 
            the video or audio stream can loose some quality and still work
      **aside: TFTP Trivial File Transfer & DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol are both connectionless
<h3>11.2.2 TCP/IP Protocol Facts</h3>
Each packet contains a packet header which is a special label that defines the sender, receiver, and order position of the packet.
    When the receiving host receives all the packets, it puts them together in order and processes the data.

    When using TCP, two hosts first establish a connection through a 3-way handshake. This handshake process is:
       1) The first host sends a SYN packet asking to create a new session.
       2) The receiving host replies with a SYN-ACK packet acknowledging that the session can be created.
       3) The first host replies with a ACK packet which then opens the session.   

           -If the sending host does not receive the ACK packet within a specified time, it sends another copy of the missing packet.
           -If the receiving host says that a packet was received out of order and one is missing, the sending host knows to send another copy of the missing packet.
        
    UDP sends the packets one at time and the receiver processes them as they come in. If a data packet is dropped along the way, it is not resent
<h3>11.2.3 Ports and Protocols</h3>
    protocols are rules to define how devices communicate with each other -- 
        65,536 Possible Ports, most aren't utilized
        
Firewalls use ports to re-route or block traffic

<b>Transfer Protocols</b>
Port 20 & 21 = FTP File Transfer Protocol - transfer between server and client
        21 transfers the 'control information'
        20 transmits the data

Port 22 = ssh Secure Shell - secure file transfer with encryption 
        most often used to login to a remote computer

Port 23 = Telnet -- no encryption -- replaced by ssh

Port 3389 = RDP Remote Desktop Protocol --- helpful for troubleshooting systems across the network

Port 139 & 137 = NetBIOS - used to share files on local network -- combined with TCP - NetBT
    139 establishes connection
    137 transfers data

Port 445 [TCP] = Server Message Block SMB - secure share and transfer data - 
    CIFS uses SMB on windows based networks

Port 427 = Service Location Protocol SLP

<b>Email Protocols</b>
Port 25 = SMTP --> send email 

Port 143 = IMAP --> receives email & keeps on server

Port 110 = POP3 --> receives email and removes from server when email is downloaded

<b>Networking Ports</b>
Port 53 = DNS Domain Name System -> matches host name to IP address

Port 67 & 68 = DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
       -67 = DHCP request
       -68 = the DHCP information to the client 

Port 161 & 162 = SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol - monitoring network devices
        -161 = SNMP manager / on the server 
        -162 = Agent  
        
Port 389 = LDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (Microsoft Active Directory)
            controls databases of things like usernames, passwords, computer accounts, user info, device info

Port 80 = HTTP Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

Port 443 = HTTPS -> HTTP over SSL = Secure - encrypted with TLS
<h3>11.2.4 Ports and Protocols Facts</h3>
<h2>11.3 Client-Side Network Configuration</h2>
Decimal Numbering System-	The decimal numbering system is the most used number system across the world. Decimal is a base-10 number system that consists of the digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
Binary Numbering System-	Binary is the number system that computers and most electronic systems use. Because these systems work on electricity, there are only two states, on and off. This is represented using the numbers 1 and 0.
Hexadecimal Numbering System-	A base-16 number system that consists of the decimal numbers 0-9 and also uses letters A-F to represent values 10-15.
MAC address-	A 48-bit physical address that is a unique identifier for all network adapters.
Logical address-	Network addresses assigned by software.
IPv4 address-	A 32-bit logical address that consists of four decimal numbers separated by a dot that can range from 0 to 255 (ex. 192.168.1.50).
Subnet mask-	Used to identify which octets in the IPv4 address are the host ID and which are the network ID.
Default gateway-	Responsible for forwarding data packets to destinations outside of the network.
IPv4 address class-	  Identifies the range of IP addresses and the default subnet mask used for the range.
Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)-	A feature that allows a device to automatically assign itself an IP address on the 169.254.0.0 network when a DHCP server or manual configuration is unavailable.
IPv6 address-	A 128-bit address made up of eight 16-bit blocks.
Unicast address-	An address assigned to a single interface for the purpose of allowing one host to send and receive data. Packets sent to a unicast address are delivered to the interface identified by that address.
Multicast address-	An address that represents a dynamic group of hosts. Packets sent to a multicast address are sent to all interfaces identified by that address.
Anycast address-	A unicast address that is assigned to more than one interface, typically belonging to different hosts.
<h3>11.3.1 Device Addressing</h3>
  the numbering systems used for networks: 
    Decimal - 0-9 - base 10 
        ex: 6,789 = six-thousand seven-hundred eighty-nine
    Binary - 0 & 1 - base 2
        ex: 01100101 = one-hundred ninety-seven
    Hexadecimal - 0-F - base 16
        ex: AF0821 = 11,470,881 in decimal 

an 8-bit binary code = 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 [0-255]

each hexadecimal character = 4-bits = nibble 
        a common use of hex is html color codes. 
        also the MAC address

MAC address - Physical Address - globally unique
    1st half is manufacturer id
    2nd half is unique device id - randomly generated

Logical address - Logical Addresss - assigned by software 
    IPv4 = 4 octets 
        ex: 192.168.5.42 

ARP Address Resolution Protocol - 

Switches build tables to memorizes packet travel routes
<h3>11.3.2 IPv4 Addressing</h3>
    unique layer 3 logical address (Layer 3 on the OSI model)

IPv4 Configuration - must be a unique address
        IPv4 address: 4 octets -- we see it as a decimal --
        Subnet Mask: lets us know which part is network and which part is host -- 0 parts are host
        Default Gateway: forwards data to desitnations outside of the network
        DNS Server Address: 

Static - manual input, won't change, prone to input error -- best used for servers, printers, routers, etc.
Dynamic - DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 

IPv4 Classes:  Class A /24 - IP starts with 0-127, subnet mask 255.0.0.0 -- allows for 16.8 million private IP addresses
               Class B /16 - starts with 128-191, subnet mask 255.255.0.0 -- allows for 1 million private addresses 
               Class C /8  - starts with 192-223, subnet mask 255.255.255.0 -- allows for 65,000 private addresses
                 Class D = starts with 224-239, multicast
                 Class E = starts with 240-255, expiremental 

IP addressess are assigned in blocks by the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)

Private IP address range -- defined in the IETFM RFC1918
        class a = 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 == 16,777,216 million addresses
        class b = 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 == 1 million addressess 
        class c = 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 == 65k IP addresses 
        class d = 224-239.  mulitcast 
        class e = 240-255, expiremental 
        
Special IPv4 Addressess:  APIPA 169 -- auto configured
                          Local Host (Loopback) = 127.0.0.1 -- ping it to check if you can receive packets
                          Broadcast = *.*.*.255 (last address in the network range)
                          Network = *.*.*.0 (first address in the network range)
<h3>11.3.3 IP Address Facts</h3>
An IPv4 address is: 
    -A 32-bit address that consists of four decimal numbers (ranging from 0-255), each separated by a dot (e.g., 192.168.1.50).
        -Each decimal number is known as an octet, as it consists of eight 1's and 0's.
        -The decimal values range from 0-255 because there are 256 (27) combinations of 1's and 0's
    -Composed of two components:
        -The host ID which is a unique value for each host
        -The network ID which identifies the network the host is on. All hosts on the network will have the same network ID

Subnet mask-	The subnet mask also consists of four octets. Each octet is usually either a 0 or 255, but not always. The subnet mask is used to identify the octets in the IPv4 address that are the host ID and those that are the network ID.
                  --255 represents the network ID and 0 represents the host ID. For example:
                
                  The subnet mask 255.255.0.0 indicates that the first two octets in the IPv4 address are the network ID and the last two octets are the host ID.

Default gateway-	The default gateway is responsible for forwarding data packets to destinations outside of the network.
        -For example, when a host requests a internet site, the request is sent to the gateway device which then forwards the request to the appropriate destination. When the requested data comes back, the gateway sends it to the requesting host device.
        -The default gateway is typically a router that sits on the edge of the network.
    The IPv4 configuration specifies the address of the default gateway.

DNS server address-	On a network, including the internet, computers use IP addresses to identify each other and specify where data should go. However, it is much easier for users to use hostnames to identify websites or other network devices.
        The DNS server is responsible converting hostnames to IP addresses. Part of the IPv4 configuration is specifying the address of the DNS server.


    -The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) manages the assignment of IP addresses on the internet. IANA is operated by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
    -IANA allocates blocks of IP addresses to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). An RIR has authority over IP addresses in a specific region of the world.
    -An RIR assigns blocks of addresses to internet service providers (ISPs).
    -An ISP assigns one or more IP addresses to individual computers or organizations connected to the internet.

    --Public IP addresses are those that are used on the internet. These are typically assigned by the ISP.
    --Private IP addresses are used on internal networks only and are not used on the internet.
            -When a device on the internal network accesses the internet, that data traffic is sent using the public IP address.
            -Because private IP addresses are never used on the internet, users in one private network can have the same IP address as users in another private network.   
<h3>11.3.4 IPv6</h3>
        the IPv4 pool has been exhausted -- IPv6 is the more modern standard.
128-bit addresses, split into 8 16-bit blocks
    each block in the IPv6 address is composed of 4 hexadecimal #s, each block is seperated by a colon

ex: 2001:0f56:0000:0000:c429:0008:0000:02d5

IPv6 has 106 trillion-trillion (Undecillion??) addressess 

simplify -- replace spans of 0000 blocks with :: -- Address Compression (replacing the blocks of 0s with ::)
   ex: 2001:0f56::c429:0008:0000:02d5

        we can also remove 'leading zeros' ::
   ex: 2001:f56::c429:8:0:2d5 
   
IPv6 Components -- split in the middle - prefix address (network) & interface id (host)
    the prefix address ex: 2001:0f56:0000:0000 
            is split into 2 additional items -- the first 48bits (1st 3) = Site Prefix = 2001:0f56:0000 
                                                the next 16bits are the subnet id = 0000 (in this example)

    the Interface ID ex: C429:0008:0000:02d5 -- the entire 64-bits at the end of the address are a unique identifier for the device 
    
    you can generate the Interface ID using the MAC addressess -- this is known as a Modified EUI 64 Interface ID

Unicast address -- reserved - Link-Local Address FE80::/10 prefix can start with FE8, FE9, FEA, FEB --> similar to APIPA   
                                    link-local addresses are used for: Auto Address Config
                                                                        Neighbor Discovery
                                                                        Subnets with NO Routers
                                                    
Unique Local Address -- private - FC00::/7 prefix, starts with either FC or FD
        -- local network addressess
    
Multicast = use an FF00::/8 prefix
                local multicast uses: FF02::/16 prefix 

Anycast = unicast that is assigned to multiple devices -- ex: Root DNS Servers

Loopback address = 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001/128   or ::1/128
            not assigned to any interface - used for testing and troubleshooting service running between the same host

Prefix-	The first 64-bits make up the prefix.
    -The prefix can be divided into various parts that identify things such as geographic region, the ISP, the network, and the subnet.
        -The first 48-bits of the address define the site prefix. The site prefix defines the location of the address and is assigned by the local ISP.
        -The next 16-bits make up the subnet ID. This defines the network the device is connected to.
    -CIDR notation can be used to indicate the prefix-length. As with an IPv4 address, this shows which portion of the address used for the prefix (network address).
        -To indicate the prefix length, add a slash (/) followed by the prefix length.
        -Full quartets with trailing 0s in the prefix address can be omitted (e.g., 2001:0DB8:4898:DAFC::/64).
    -Because addresses can be allocated based on physical location, the prefix generally identifies the location of the host. The prefix is often referred to as the global routing prefix.

Interface ID-	The last 64-bits in the address is the interface ID. This is a unique identifier for each device, similar to a MAC address.
        -Addresses are assigned to interfaces (network connections), not to the host. Technically, the interface ID is not a host address, but is often referred to as the host address.
        -Interface IDs must be unique within a subnet, but the same interface ID can exist on multiple subnets.
    To ensure that the interface ID is unique for every host on the network, IPv6 uses the Extended Unique Identifier 64 (EUI-64) format. Following are some details of the EUI-64 format:
        -Since each device is hard-wired with a unique 48-bit hardware address called the MAC address, the EUI-64 format uses it to generate a unique interface ID.
    -The EUI-64 format:
        -Converts the MAC address to binary.
        -Flips the 7th bit from the left (from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1). This bit is called the universal/local (U/L) bit.
        -Inserts the 16-bit hexadecimal value FFFE in the middle.

            -For example, the address for a host with a MAC address of 20-0C-FB-BC-A0-07 would start with the following EUI-64 interface ID: 200C:FBFF:FEBC:A007
    The interface ID can also be generated using a special algorithm that generates a completely randomized ID. This guarantees that each device will have a unique ID.

<h3>11.3.9 quiz facts to remeber</h3>
- default address range used by APIPA is 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254

- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to match a device's IP address to its MAC address. Some network devices, such as switches, 
   will build tables to match MAC addresses with IP addresses in order to always know where to send packets to. When a host wants 
   to send some data, it uses ARP to send a broadcast message out on the network, requesting that the host with a specific IP address respond
    with its MAC address. When the sending host gets the response, it can then match up the MAC address and IP address.

- The first octet of a Class A address is in the range of 1 to 126. 
  The first octet of a Class B address is in the range of 128 to 191. 
  The first octet of a Class C address is in the range of 192 to 223.    

- 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address for any device. This special address means "this host." If you ping the loopback address, the TCP/IP configuration is tested.
   A successful test means that TCP/IP is correctly configured on the host.
 
- The first half (first six digits) of a MAC address is assigned to each manufacturer by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). 
  The rest of the MAC address consists of a unique, randomly generated value.   

- You can use the Domain Name System (DNS) to get the IP address from a given hostname. You can also use the local hosts file to map hostnames to IP addresses. 
  On Windows systems, this file is located in C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\.  

- Class A networks use a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 and have numbers between 0 and 126 in their first octet. Class B networks use a default subnet mask 
  of 255.255.0.0 and have numbers between 128 and 191 as their first octet. Class C networks use a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 and have numbers 
  between 192 and 223 as their first octet. In this question, the IP addresses that fall in the Class B IP address range are 191.168.2.15, 129.0.0.1, and 168.16.5.1.  

- An IPv6 address is a 128-bit binary number that uses the first 64 bits as the address prefix and the last 64 bits of the address as the interface ID. The 128-bit binary
  number is organized into 32 hexadecimal numbers that are organized further into eight quartets. The last four quartets correspond with the last 64 bits of the IPv6 address.

- An IPv6 IP address is a 128-bit address listed as eight 16-bit hexadecimal sections. Leading 0s can be omitted in each section. 6384:1319:7700:7631:446A:5511:8940:2552 is a 
  valid IPv6 IP address. A single set of all-zero sections can be abbreviated with two colons (::). 141::15:0:0:1 would also be a valid way of writing that address.

- IP version 6 addresses are made up of 32 hexadecimal numbers organized into eight quartets. The quartets are separated by colons. An IPv6 address is a 128-bit number (128 binary digits).
   IP version 4 addresses use decimal numbers organized into four octets and separated by periods.

<h3>11.4.1 Server Roles</h3>
  server is a computer system that manages access to network resources.

Server Roles:  - DNS
               - DHCP
               - MAIL
               
enable the server role - needs server OS -- enable the role in the
        in windows you enable the role and windows will download the necessary resources

File Sharing 
Print sharing
Web server - for internet or intranet windows uses iis; linux uses apache

server security roles : Authentication - who user is 
                        Authorization - access / permissions 
                        Monitoring - user activity
                        System Logs - Capture events 
                        
configure server as DNS server - turns the ip to the host name (FQDN)
    hierarchical naming system = organized with a root that other levels branch from
     ex: www.testout.com -- first is the root level 
                    .com -> Top-Level Domain (TLDs)
                    .testout -> Domain Name 
                    www -> Host Name (internal might be server 1)

there are 13 Root level servers?? 
  and over 1500 TLDs -- .edu, .org, .gov, .com, .biz, .tv are just a few
  
DNS Records A -> host to IPv4 address
          AAAA -> host to IPv6 address                

DHCP role - auto assign ip address from the DHCP scope 
    the scope defines the address range available and subnet mask
      specify exclusion and reservation ip addresses -- exclusions block range from being used
                                                     -- reservation simply reserves a number or group of number for items by MAC address
    DHCP lease time -- long if it doesnt change, short for a place like a coffee shop

Email server -> SMTP - send mail - port 25
                IMAP - receive and keep email on server - port 143
                POP3 - receive email and erase from server when downloaded - port 110

spam and malware protections - Email Authentication
   -- DKIM DomainKeys Identified Mail - verifies sender domain              
   -- SPF Sender Policy Framework - verifies the IP address (a step further than DKIM)
   -- DMARC Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance - combines DKIM and SPF
<h3>11.4.2 Server Role Facts</h3>     
Root level-	 The root level is the highest level in the DNS hierarchy. The DNS root level is represented by a period at the end of the of the FQDN. When typing the FQDN into a web browser, the period is typically not included. The period is mainly used when defining DNS records on the server.
Top-level domain-	The top-level domain (TLD) names have extensions such as com, edu, gov, org, etc.
Domain name-	The domain name is unique to each organization. The DNS domain is referred to as distributed because this portion is unique to each organization or group. Each organization is responsible for maintaining its own namespace.
Hostname-	 This is the name of specific hosts on the network.
    -On an internal network, an example of a hostname could be server1 or server2.
    -On the internet, this is typically www. On a webserver, www is the name of the root folder that all website files are stored in.

A DNS zone is defined using a DNS zone file.

    -The DNS zone file is a text document stored on each server and defines the DNS zone and how it should function.
    -Each DNS zone must have its own zone file.
    -When defining a DNS zone, you must specify a forward lookup zone or a reverse lookup zone.
        -A forward lookup zone matches the hostname to the IP address.
        -A reverse lookup zone matches the IP address to the hostname.
    -These zones need to be defined because limitations in DNS do not allow this to happen automatically.

A (host address)-	Maps an IPv4 (32-bit) DNS host name to an IP address. This is the most common resource record type.
AAAA (quad-A)-	 Maps an IPv6 (128-bit) DNS host name to an IP address.
Pointer (PTR)-  Maps an IP address to a host name (by pointing to an A record).
Canonical Name (CNAME)-	 Provides alternate names (or aliases) to hosts that already have a host record. For example:
        sales.testout can be mapped to the IP address of testout.com
    If a single A record is used with multiple CNAME records, only the A record needs to be modified when the IP address changes.
Mail Exchange (MX)-  Identifies servers used for handling email
TXT-	Stores plaintext notes in a DNS zone. This record type can be used to help prevent email spam and verify domain ownership.
Start of Authority (SOA)-	Stores all the administration information about the DNS zone. For example, the administrator's email address, TTL values, primary name server, etc., is recorded in this file.
        SOA records are very important in the zone transfer process.
Name Server (NS)-	Defines the authoritative server for a specific domain. This record identifies all name servers that can perform name resolution for the zone.
    Typically, there is an entry for the primary server and all secondary servers for the zone (all authoritative DNS servers).
DNS Service (SRV)-  Defines a host and port for a specific service such as voice over IP (VoIP). This allows clients to find services through DNS. Windows automatically creates these records as needed. 

DHCP - 

IP range-	The IP range defines the range of IP addresses that the DHCP server can assign. When a new device connects to the network, the DHCP server will assign the next available address.

    When you define the IP range, be aware that you can assign:
        -All available addresses in the network.
        -Specific ranges (e.g., 192.168.5.50 - 192.168.5.100). Specifying a limited number of addresses can help limit the number of connections to the network.

Subnet mask- 	The subnet mask defines the network ID and host ID. This must be defined.

Exclusions-	 Exclusions are IP addresses that the DHCP server will not assign.
        -These addresses are typically used for devices such as servers, printers, routers, or other network devices that must have a static IP address.
        -These IP addresses must be manually configured on each device.
            *It's important to remember that the exclusion addresses must fall within the configured IP range.

Reservations-	Reservation IP addresses will also not be assigned by the DHCP server.
        -Instead of manually configuring the IP information on each device that needs a static IP, you can assign reservations on the DHCP server using the device's MAC address.
        -Whenever that device connects to the network, the DHCP server assigns it the reserved IP configuration.

DHCP lease time-	An IP configuration is assigned to a device for a specified amount of time. This is the DHCP lease. Keep in mind:
    -While a lease is active, that IP address cannot be reassigned, even if the device disconnects from the network.
    -When the lease is half-way over, the device attempts to renew the lease if it's still connected to the network.
    -A lease can be set for a few hours, days, weeks, or months.
    -If the device stays connected to the network, you should probably set the lease to last for days. However, if clients are connecting to a guest network and are coming and going, you should probably set the lease to a short time so available addresses aren't tied up.

Default gateway-	The default gateway defines where data packets that are leaving the network (e.g., internet packets), should go.

DNS server-	 If you are using a specific DNS server, define it in the scope.

WINS server-	Most networks do not use WINS anymore, but if it is needed, you can define it in the DHCP scope.

<b>Mail Serverss</b>
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) - Used for outgoing emails and operates on port 25.
Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) - Used for incoming emails and operates on port 110. Emails are downloaded to the local computer and then removed from the email server.
Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - Used for incoming emails and operates on port 143. Emails are kept on the email server, allowing users to access their email from multiple devices.

Spam Protections --

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)-	DKIM protects against spoofed emails by verifying the sender's domain address.
    -A spoofed email looks like it comes from a legitimate user, but in fact comes from somewhere else.
    -DKIM creates a DNS TXT file on the sender's email server. The recipient can check the DNS record to verify the sender's domain is legitimate.
    -DKIM also creates a pair of encryption keys, one private key and one public key.
        -The public key is sent along with the email to digitally sign the email.
        -The private key is kept on the email server, so the receiver is able validate the sender's identity.

Sender Policy Frameworks (SPF)-  SPF is also used to protect against spoofed emails. Instead of using encryption keys, a SPF record is created in the sender's DNS server. The SPF contains:
    -The SPF version being used.
    -The IPs that are authorized to send emails for the domain.
    -Any other third-party domains that are authorized to send emails for the domain.
    -An all tag at the end which indicates the policy that should be applied when the receiving server detects a server that is not part of the SPF record.

    The recipient can check the SPF record and verify the IP address of the domain the email comes from. If the IP address matches the DNS records, the email is marked as safe. If the IP address does not match the DNS records, the email is flagged and blocked.

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)-	DMARC combines the protections of both DKIM and SPF to protect users from malicious emails. DKIM:
    -Verifies the email sender.
    -Tells the recipient what to do if neither authentication method passes.
    -Allows the recipient to tell the sender about messages that pass or fail DMARC authentication.

<h3>11.4.7 Internet Appliance Facts</h3>  
Round robin-	The most basic algorithm. Using this algorithm, the servers handle network requests in sequential order. The load balancer does not monitor each server's current load, as it assumes the servers can handle each request in the same amount of time.
            This can still lead to a server getting overwhelmed.

Weighted round robin-	This algorithm works the same as the round robin, but takes the server's power into consideration. A more powerful server is sent more traffic than less powerful servers.

Least connections-	The least connections algorithm looks at the active connections each server is handling and sends the network traffic to the server that currently has the lowest number of connections. This algorithm:
    Treats each network request equally.
        -Does not take into account that some requests require more time.
        -Does not take into account the power of each server.
    For example, if a request comes in that will take a long time to process, the load balancer can't take this into consideration. It might direct that traffic to the next server in line, but that server might already be dealing with another request. This can cause that server to get backed up and slow down the network.

Weighted least connections-	 This algorithm distributes traffic based on the active connections and the processing power of each server.

Source IP hash-  This algorithm creates a hash key based on the source and destination IP addresses. The hash key is assigned to a server and all requests for the remainder of the active session are handled by that same server.      

Firewall-	The firewall is responsible for monitoring and controlling all incoming and outgoing traffic. The firewall controls the flow of data based on rules that have been configured by the network administrator.
    Most firewalls are configured to detect the type of traffic; the source and destination addresses; and ports.

Intrusion prevention system (IPS)-	The intrusion prevention system monitors all network traffic looking for anything out of the ordinary. When malicious or suspicious packets are detected, the IPS blocks the packets and notifies the network security team so further action can be taken.

Anti-malware-	Many UTM appliances use anti-malware software to detect and prevent malware from infecting the network.
    Malware can include viruses, spyware, ransomware, and other malicious software. It should be blocked from the network. Malware programs can devastate a network by destroying, stealing, or blocking access to critical data and infrastructure.

Content filtering-	Similar to the proxy server, the UTM can monitor HTTP requests and block unauthorized web sites. The rules are configured by the network administrator.
<h3>11.4.8 IoT Internet of Things</h3>
IoT - system of connected computing devices - send information without human interaction 
    also IoE Internet of Everything because it is everywhere these days

IoT Systems - 4 main systems that work together: the device - contains sensors that collect data 
                                                 gateway system - comunicates between device and sends data to cloud 
                                                 data storage - in the cloud the data is processed and analyzed and relayed to the application server
                                                 remote control - data is relayed to the user interface, email, text -> allow you to do something on a remote app to control the security camera, etc... 

IoT architecture - defines how it works and the process each device goes through - 5 layers:
        -Edge Technology - all hardware part in IoT device -- all sensors / actuators 
        -Access Gateway - wear all data is gathered and compressed and converted to digital form - takes care of message routing, ID and subscription  
        -Internet - main bridge between 2 endpoints - connects to the cloud, to other systems, the gateway... 
        -Middleware - covers process that happen in the cloud - device information discovery 
        -Application - responsible for delivering end data to user

IoT protocols - wi-fi - wireless connection
                bluetooth low energy BLE - used in smart device
                Zigbee - open, max 60 feet, unlimited hops, 2.4GHz -- may have conflict with other devices at 2.4GHz range   
                Z-Wave - closed, goes 250 ft, but only 4 hops max, 908.42 MHz -- no major conflicts with other devices

<h3>11.4.10 IoT Facts</h3>    
<b>Systems</b> 
Devices	IoT-  devices are built with sensors that capture data. These sensors can be included in cameras, GPS systems, temperature reading equipment, and heart monitoring equipment.
    The sensors in the device collect data and send it to the cloud.

Gateway system-	In order to send data to the cloud, IoT devices need a connection. The gateway acts as the bridge between the device and the cloud.

Data storage	Once the data reaches the cloud, it is processed and analyzed by software. Examples include the temperature reading is checked, trespassers are detected on the security camera video feed, and location is determined on a GPS device.
    After the received data is processed completely, the result or conclusion is sent to the device application server and interface.

Remote control	App notifications, emails, and text messages make the information gathered by the device available to the user. Action by the device can be started as follows:
    -Predefined rules setup by the user cause the device to take action automatically.
    -A user uses an app or other interface to start an action. The user may or may not be prompted by the device.
<b>Architecture</b>
Edge technology-	The edge technology layer includes all the hardware parts in the IoT system such as sensors, RFID tags, readers, etc. This sensor hardware collects the data for the IoT device.
    These sensors can convert the sensory information they capture into data for analysis.

Access gateway-	 The access gateway layer is where all the data gathered at the edge layer is collected and compressed to an optimal size for analysis.
    This is also the point when the data is converted to a digital form. In addition, this layer takes care of message routing, message identification, and subscribing.

Internet-	The internet layer is the main bridge between two endpoints in an IoT system. It connects devices to other devices, the cloud, the gateway, and backend data sharing.
    The internet layer sends the data to the middleware layer. Some systems may conduct advanced analytics and pre-processing during this stage.

Middleware-  The middleware layer includes the processes that happen in the cloud such as:
        -In-depth processing
        -Data management
        -Device management
        -Data aggregation
        -Data filtering
        -Device information discovery
        -Access control
        -Revision for feedback
    This layer acts as the interface between the hardware and application layers; thatâ€™s why itâ€™s called the middleware layer.

    Once all the quality standards and requirements are met, the processed and analyzed data is ready to be sent back to the device.

Application-	The application layer is the top layer in the IoT architecture. Its primary responsibility is to deliver the analyzed and processed data to the end user.
    The user checks the data and may send commands to the devices or sensors. The process then restarts from the beginning.
<b>Protocols</b>    
Wi-Fi-	Wi-Fi is very commonly implemented in wireless local area networking and allows many types of devices to communicate with each other.
    Wi-Fi Direct uses peer-to-peer communication without a set wireless access point.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-	Bluetooth Low Energy, also known as Bluetooth Smart, is a wireless, personal area network protocol. It supports low-power, long-use IoT needs. It can be used in such sectors as healthcare, security, entertainment, and fitness.

Zigbee-	Zigbee is one of the most common short-range IoT communication protocols. Zigbee has the following characteristics:
    -Is open standard, which means anyone can develop and customize it as needed.
    -Has a maximum distance of 60 feet between each hop.
    -Allows an unlimited number of hops from a device to the hub.
    -Operates at the 2.4 GHz frequency.

Z-Wave-	Z-Wave is the other most common short range IoT communication protocol. Z-Wave has the following characteristics:
    -Is closed standard, which means devices must meet specific requirements to be able to use it.
    -Has a maximum distance of 250 feet between each hop.
    -Can travel only four hops from a device to the hub.
    -Operates at the 908.42 MHz frequency.

<h3>11.4.13 Embedded Systems (SCADA) Facts</h3>                           
Embedded systems have the following characteristics:

    -Are single-function devices.
    -Are static or sealed systems. This means the hardware cannot be swapped out.
    -Are reactive and make changes in real-time based on feedback from built-in sensors.
    -Must be controlled by a microprocessor, have memory, and contain components to connect external devices such as USB ports.
    -Use a real-time operating system (RTOS). This operating system handles processes in a deterministic manner. Key points regarding a RTOS are:
        -Different algorithms are used to determine the task that should be performed next.
        -Tasks are given individual priority by the program developer, so the RTOS knows the order to perform that tasks in.
        -RTOS systems allow for tasks to be processed with almost no latency. This is vitally important for many embedded devices to work properly.

    Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)-	 The application-specific integrated circuit chip is created to perform a single function. ASIC chips:
        -Are typically custom designed.
        -Are used by a company in a single product.
        -Have an expensive and time-consuming development process.
        -Offer high performance with low power consumption.
    
    System-on-chip (SoC)-	A system-on-chip incorporates all components on the board, including:
        -Processor
        -Memory
        -Peripheral functions
    
    Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-	A field-programmable gate array is physically setup like an ASIC or SoC, but the programming is configured by the end-user. ASIC and SoC chips have the instructions hard coded into them and cannot be changed.        

    Programmable logic controller (PLC)-	A PLC is a specialized controller that can be programmed to perform specific tasks. Multiple PLCs can be combined and configured to work together to carry out complex tasks.

    Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)-	SCADA controllers can monitor and control PLC systems. They gather data and adjust the system based on the data acquired from sensors.

    Human-machine interface (HMI)-	The HMI can be either a touch-screen control panel or software running on a computer system. The HMI allows the operator to make configuration changes in the system.

    Distributed control system (DCS)-	A DCS is a customized all-in-one package that contains the needed PLCs, SCADA controller, and HMI. These are typically custom designed for specific needs.

    Modbus- 	Modbus is a special network protocol that controller systems use to communicate with each other. Modbus originally ran through a serial interface but has evolved to work over Ethernet and TCP/IP.
<h3>11.4.14 Quiz Facts</h3>
-The forward lookup zone matches the hostname to the IP address.

-Reservations are static IP addresses that are not dynamically assigned by the DHCP server. Reservations are assigned by the DHCP server using the device's MAC address. Whenever the device with the specified MAC address connects to the network, 
  the DHCP server assigns the reserved static IP configuration to that device.

-The intrusion prevention system (IPS) monitors all network traffic, looking for anything out of the ordinary. When malicious or suspicious packets are detected, the IPS blocks the packets and notifies the network security team so further action can be taken.

-Unified Threat Management (UTM) appliance. A UTM combines multiple functions into one single device, including the firewall, IPS, content filtering, VPN support, and much more.

-Hackers and privacy are two majors concerns for IoT users. Because IoT devices are closely connected, all a hacker has to do is exploit one vulnerability to manipulate all the data, rendering it unusable. Additionally, companies that make and distribute consumer
 IoT devices could use those devices to obtain and sell users' personal data.

-Zigbee and Z-Wave are two radio protocols that many IoT devices work with because they are designed for low-data rate, low-power applications. These protocols link all IoT devices to form a mesh network.

-A smart thermostat learns from your habits and schedule, allows you to control the climate in your home remotely, shows you energy consumption in real time, and adjusts itself depending on ambient conditions.

    A smart switch allows you to control hardwired lights, ceiling fans, fireplaces, small appliances, and garbage disposals.

    A smart bulb can change colors, track motion, stream audio over Bluetooth, and double as a connected camera, but it's only smart when turned on.

    A smart plug is an easy solution for making appliances such as lamps, coffee makers, and toasters smart.

    A smart security camera uses an RF transmitter and may include such features as motion detection, scheduled recording, remote viewing, and automatic cloud storage.

    A smart door lock uses a wireless protocol and a cryptographic key to execute the authorization process. A smart door can also monitor access and send alerts related to a device's status.

    A smart speaker/digital assistant uses voice recognition software and activates through a Wake Word or Hot Word.

-Two of the four IoT systems that work together for endpoint communication include the gateway system and data storage. The gateway system connects an IoT device to the cloud, while data storage is the system in the cloud that stores,
  processes, and analyzes the data.

-A DCS is a customized, all-in-one package that contains the needed PLCs, SCADA controller, and HMI. DCSs are typically custom-designed for specific needs.

-Embedded devices are sealed systems, which means that they are typically unknown environments. This means that the security administrator will not always know which hardware is in the device.

<h3>11.5.3 Wirelss Facts</h3>
All speeds and distances are theoretical and will typically be achieved only in an optimal environment.

    -Transmission speeds are affected by distance, obstructions (such as walls), and interference.
    -Maximum signal distance depends on several factors, including obstructions, antenna strength, and interference. For example, the actual distance for communications in a typical environment (with one or two walls) is roughly half of the maximum.
    -Because transmission speeds decrease with distance, either the maximum distance or the maximum speed can be achieved, but not both.

Long-Range Wireless 

    -If the locations are only a short distance apart, you can install a high-end wireless access point with special antennas. These networks still use the unlicensed frequencies and appropriate 802.11 standard.
    -If the network locations are spread across a longer distance, special equipment is needed. These long-range networks also need special permission to use a licensed frequency range such as 900 MHz or 3.65 GHz.
    -Regardless of the range, some wireless access points allow the power to be increased. Increasing the power allows the access point to transmit a longer distance, but can lead to overheating and instability.
    -Always follow FCC guidance and requirements if increasing the power as this can cause interference with other wireless devices in the area.
<h3>11.5.4 Wireless Security</h3>
    to keep the network we safe we implement security steps.

    Authentication - prove your identity 
            Open Network - Public Free Wifi
                    captive portal - redirected to agree to terms and conditions

                    some devices use NFC (near field communication) to share WPS
            802.1x -> one of the most secure ways to connect -> enables virtual port
                    supplicant = wireless client
                    authenticator = NAS Network Access Server
                    authentication server = RADIUS Server - Remote Authentication Dial-In Service 
                        AAA protocol = authentication, authorization, accounting  

    encrypt the wireless communication: 
            WPA2-PSK - uses AES-CCMP a 128-bit key
            WPA2-Enterprise - Four-Way Handshake: 1)access point - send clear text challange
                                                  2)client - encrypt challange -> SNonce+MIC

-Change default credentials             
-Disable SSID Broadcast
-MAC address filtering
-Update Firmware
-Enable and Configure Firewall
<h3>11.5.5 Wireless Security Facts</h3>                      
When using 802.1x authentication for wireless networks with RADIUS, keep in mind:
    -A RADIUS server is required to centralize user account and authentication information. A centralized database for user authentication is required to allow wireless clients to roam between cells and authenticate using the same account information.
    -A PKI is required for issuing certificates. At a minimum, the RADIUS server must have a server certificate. To support mutual authentication, each client must also have a certificate.
    -The wireless access point is a RADIUS client.
    -The wireless access point forwards the wireless device's credentials to the RADIUS server for authentication.
    -A RADIUS federation is multiple RADIUS servers that communicate with each other after establishing a trust relationship. These servers may be on different networks and could span multiple organizations.
<h3>11.5.6 Wireless Encryption and Authentication</h3>
    properly secure the data across the wireless network

Encryption Algorithms: 
        WPA Wi-fi Protected Access -> most popular security protocol (WPA2 or WPA3 most used)
        
        TKIP Temporal Key Integrity Protocol -> encryption -- older, fixed problem with WEP  
                                                    each packet gets encryption - Rivest Cipher 4
        AES Advanced Encryption Standard -> encryption -- replaced TKIP -> 128 bits
                                            keys up to 256 bits in length
                                            -based on Rijndael algorithm
                                            often paired with CCMP Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication

Authentication Protocols: 
Remote Authentication Dial-In Service (RADIUS) - port 1812 = authentication & authorization 
                                                         port 1813 = accounting
                                                         
Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System (TACACS+) - Cisco - address RADIUS security concerns
                                                        encrypts all packets
                                                        port 49 - only uses 49

AAA Protocols - Authentication = user's ID
                Authorization = access allowed
                Accounting = log what user does  

Kerberos - MIT - used by Microsoft 3 part: Client: client login to Auth Server and Auth Server issues Session Key                           
                                           Authentication Server: issues client TGT and Session Key (TGT = Ticket Granting Ticket) 
                                           Trusted Key Distribution Center (KDC): client then sends the Session key and TGT (issued by Auth Server)
                                                  and KDC [aka Ticket Granting Server] sends the client an Authentication Ticket for the session. 

    Kerberos only provides Authentication [no authorization or accounting]
        often run with RADIUS or another Protocol for security

<h3>11.5.15 Infrared, Bluetooth, and NFC Facts</h3>                                    
    <b>Bluetooth Version</b>
    -1.0-	Operates at a range of 10 meters and speeds up to 1 Mbps.
    -2.0-	Operates at a range up to 30 meters and speeds up to 1 Mbps. A special mode called Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) enables transfer rates up to 3 Mbps.
    -3.0-	Operates at a range up to 30 meters and speeds up to 1 Mbps. A special mode known as High Speed (HS) allows the Bluetooth device to use a nearby 802.11 link to achieve speeds up to 24 Mbps.
    -4.0-	Operates at a range up to 60 meters and speeds up to 1 Mbps (24 Mbps when using High Speed mode).
        --Version 4.0 introduced the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard.
            -BLE reduces the power consumption of Bluetooth devices.
    -5.0-	Operates at a range up to 240 meters and speeds up to 2 Mbps (48 Mbps when using High Speed mode).
        --Bluetooth 5 improves the performance of BLE devices.
            -It also introduced the dual audio feature which allows audio to play simultaneously on two connected devices.

    <b>RFID</b> uses radio waves to transmit data from small circuit boards to special scanners 
    -Active RFID tags have on-board batteries and can send signals over a long distance. Toll passes in vehicles use active RFID.
    -Passive RFID are not powered and rely on the energy transferred by the scanner to transmit data. ID badges, credit cards, and similar devices use these tags. 

    <b>NFC</b>
    NFC is a newer technology that is built on RFID. NFC allows two-way communication between two devices that are within 2 inches of each other.
        -NFC operates in the 13.56 MHz frequency. It has a maximum transmission speed of 424 Kbps.
        -Special chips called NFC chips can send, receive, and store data.
        -Devices using NFC operate in one of three modes:
            -Reader/writer mode is used to read information stored on an NFC chip.
            -Peer-to-Peer mode enables two devices to communicate and exchange information.
            -Card Emulation mode enables the device to function as a smart card to perform contactless payment or ticketing. This mode is typically used by smart phones.
        -Data transmissions can be secured by using encryption algorithms.
<h3>11.5.16 Quiz Facts</h3>
- Remote Authentication Dial-In Service (RADIUS):

    -Sends a user's credentials over UDP.
    -Only encrypts the password.

- Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System (TACACS+):
    -Sends a user's credentials over TCP.

Kerberos:
    -Is a key component of Windows Active Directory.
    -Provides a trusted Key Distribution Center (KDC).

-Infrared wireless transmissions work best for devices within 1 meter, but can operate up to 2 meters in areas with a few obstacles in between.

- Bluetooth transmission distance depends on the device class. The following rules apply:
        -Class 3 devices transmit up to 1 meter.
        -Class 2 devices transmit up to 10 meters.
        -Class 1 devices transmit up to 100 meters.

-NFC allows two-way communication between two devices, but they must be within a few centimeters of each other.    

-A Bluetooth connection automatically detects Bluetooth-enabled devices and creates a wireless PAN between them. Bluetooth can be used for both voice and data signals, 
   and it also provides 128-bit encryption to protect sensitive information in transit.
 
-Near Field Communication, or NFC, uses the 13.56 MHz frequency and has a very short range. In order for devices to communicate, they have to be within two inches of 
   each other. NFC chips are being used for applications such as passports and credit cards to contain all the information about the passport holder or the credit card 
   account. NFC chips use encryption algorithms to secure the connection, but constantly emit a signal and use a much slower transmission speed than other wireless technologies.   

-Near Field Communication (NFC) enables two electronic devices, one of which is typically a mobile device such as a smartphone, to establish communication within 10 cm (3.9 in) of each other. 
     A popular NFC application is mobile proximity payments.   
    
-Active RFID tags have on-board batteries and can send signals over a long distance. Toll passes in vehicles use active RFID.

-Passive RFID tags are not powered and rely on the energy transferred by the scanner to transmit data. 
   These tags are seen in ID badges, credit cards, and other similar devices.
