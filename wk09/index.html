<h3>12.1.10 Laptop Quiz Facts</h3>
- A laptop with a removable or rotating screen gives the user the flexibility of a notepad or tablet computer, especially if stylus functionality is included.

- The random cursor movements are caused by the user interacting with the touchpad. Using the special function keys to disable the touchpad will remedy the unwanted interactions.

- Before replacing the video card, find the documentation to determine the location of screws and to identify installation sequences for accessing the system components.

- Some notebooks have processors soldered onto the motherboard. On these systems, you will not be able to upgrade or replace the processor. Instead, the best solution is to 
   upgrade the motherboard with a faster processor.

- The two main problems encountered with LCD backlights are a burnt-out CCFL or a malfunctioning inverter.

- To fix this problem, you need to recalibrate the touchpad. The most common problem for a touchpad is that the mouse cursor is not controlled properly based on where you press. 
    Some notebooks recalibrate the touchpad at every system boot. Most notebooks include a utility for calibrating the touchpad.

- The wireless connection is affected by the internal antenna. After replacing a video card or LCD screen, be sure to reconnect the antenna.

- You can add devices (such as a wireless card) to a notebook computer using USB or ExpressCard interfaces.

<h3>12.2.4 Mobile Device Displays and Components</h3>
- If you reach a point where the bezel will not separate, you have probably missed a screw.

- Manufacturers often use the display bezel to run wires for the Wi-Fi antenna or to integrate a webcam or microphone.
        -The touchscreen digitizer is placed in front of the mobile device display to read touchscreen events.
        -An inverter converts DC power to AC power for the screen. The inverter may be included in the device's motherboard or be part of the display.
        -OLED is a type of display, not a component that is installed under the bezel.
        -OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer and is often referred to when deciding on whether or not to purchase replacement parts for a mobile device display. 

- If a touchscreen is not embedded into the display during manufacturing, a thin glass digitizer is placed in front of the display to read touch events.

- OLED is taking over, and many devices that use LCD are transitioning to OLED. OLED is thinner and lighter than LCD and can be made flexible, allowing for the development of foldable smartphones.
        - TN (twisted nematic), VA (vertical alignment), and IPS (in-plane switching) are all types of LCD technologies. They do not allow flexible folding of a mobile device display.

- LCD monitors are backlit. In order to produce a bright enough light, an inverter is included on the laptop's motherboard (or may be part of the display). The inverter converts DC power to AC power for the screen.

- After you place the laptop on a static mat, attach the static wristband to your wrist, and unplug the laptop, you should then remove the battery.
        - After removing the battery, you can then remove the bezel, the screen, and the video ribbon.

- When purchasing an OEM part, you are guaranteed that the part will work as a replacement. You also will have confidence that the part is of the same quality as the part you are replacing.

- If the display on your older notebook often dims or goes blank, it is probably an indication that your LCD screen is using a CCFL inverter to backlight the LCD display. The CCFL inverter needs to be replaced. 
   Replacing the inverter is much less expensive than replacing the LCD display.

- In-plane switching (IPS) has a high response rate. This is your best choice for touchscreen displays.
        - Twisted nematic (TN) was used in early LCD displays to enable a display with batteries. This technology is not used with touchscreen displays.
        - Vertical alignment (VA) was an early adoption of color LCD. While it produces a truer black and offers a wider viewing angle, it suffers from distortion when transitioning colors and is not used for touchscreen displays.
        - A touch screen digitizer (TSD) is not an LCD display technology. It is used if a touchscreen is not embedded into the display during manufacturing. A TSD is a thin glass digitizer that is placed in front of the display to read touch events.   

- Vertical alignment (VA) produces a truer black and offers a wider viewing angle. However, this type of LCD display often suffers from distortion when transitioning colors.
        - Twisted nematic (TN) was used in early LCD displays. TN displays used low operating voltages, making their use with batteries possible. They are still used for monochrome alphanumeric displays and do not distort images.
        - IPS (in-plane switching) has a high response rate and is used in LCD displays, as this technology does not distort images when changing colors. IPS is the best choice for use on touchscreen displays.
        - Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) is a display technology that is gradually replacing LCD. OLED is not an LCD technology.

<h3>12.3. Power Quiz Facts</h3>
- Hibernate saves the RAM contents to a hibernation file. All other components are turned off. When the computer is restarted, the loader reads the hibernation file and jumps to the system's previous, pre-hibernation location.
        - Working means the computer is running and is usable.
        - Standby means that RAM is fully powered on, but screen and storages devices are powered down. This allows the system to quickly change to the Working state.
        - Off means the system is completely turned off and is not consuming any power. No information from RAM is saved.

- Hibernate saves the state of your computer to the hard disk and completely powers off your computer. When the devices resumes, the saved state is restored to RAM, and you can pick up where you left off.        

- The computer must have sufficient disk space to save the contents of RAM to a hibernation file on your internal hard disk.

- The most likely cause of your power issue is that you were given the wrong adapter for the laptop. Most adapters are not interchangeable between laptops, as they require varying amounts of voltage and amperage. Even if the plug for the
    laptop is the correct size, the adapter may not be generating sufficient power to charge the laptop battery.

- Hibernation saves everything in RAM to the hard drive. You need at least as much free disk space as you have RAM.

- The best description provided is that a USB device stops providing power to a port when a USB device is not in use.

- Nickel Cadmium (NiCad) batteries take up the most space, while Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries take up the least space.
        - The most expensive of the Nickel-based batteries is Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH).
        - Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries cannot be overcharged, but they also suffer from swelling and catching fire.

- Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries offer the greatest storage capacity in the smallest amount of space.
