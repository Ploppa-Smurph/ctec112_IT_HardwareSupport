<h3>12.1.10 Laptop Quiz Facts</h3>
- A laptop with a removable or rotating screen gives the user the flexibility of a notepad or tablet computer, especially if stylus functionality is included.

- The random cursor movements are caused by the user interacting with the touchpad. Using the special function keys to disable the touchpad will remedy the unwanted interactions.

- Before replacing the video card, find the documentation to determine the location of screws and to identify installation sequences for accessing the system components.

- Some notebooks have processors soldered onto the motherboard. On these systems, you will not be able to upgrade or replace the processor. Instead, the best solution is to 
   upgrade the motherboard with a faster processor.

- The two main problems encountered with LCD backlights are a burnt-out CCFL or a malfunctioning inverter.

- To fix this problem, you need to recalibrate the touchpad. The most common problem for a touchpad is that the mouse cursor is not controlled properly based on where you press. 
    Some notebooks recalibrate the touchpad at every system boot. Most notebooks include a utility for calibrating the touchpad.

- The wireless connection is affected by the internal antenna. After replacing a video card or LCD screen, be sure to reconnect the antenna.

- You can add devices (such as a wireless card) to a notebook computer using USB or ExpressCard interfaces.

<h3>12.2.4 Mobile Device Displays and Components</h3>
- If you reach a point where the bezel will not separate, you have probably missed a screw.

- Manufacturers often use the display bezel to run wires for the Wi-Fi antenna or to integrate a webcam or microphone.
        -The touchscreen digitizer is placed in front of the mobile device display to read touchscreen events.
        -An inverter converts DC power to AC power for the screen. The inverter may be included in the device's motherboard or be part of the display.
        -OLED is a type of display, not a component that is installed under the bezel.
        -OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer and is often referred to when deciding on whether or not to purchase replacement parts for a mobile device display. 

- If a touchscreen is not embedded into the display during manufacturing, a thin glass digitizer is placed in front of the display to read touch events.

- OLED is taking over, and many devices that use LCD are transitioning to OLED. OLED is thinner and lighter than LCD and can be made flexible, allowing for the development of foldable smartphones.
        - TN (twisted nematic), VA (vertical alignment), and IPS (in-plane switching) are all types of LCD technologies. They do not allow flexible folding of a mobile device display.

- LCD monitors are backlit. In order to produce a bright enough light, an inverter is included on the laptop's motherboard (or may be part of the display). The inverter converts DC power to AC power for the screen.

- After you place the laptop on a static mat, attach the static wristband to your wrist, and unplug the laptop, you should then remove the battery.
        - After removing the battery, you can then remove the bezel, the screen, and the video ribbon.

- When purchasing an OEM part, you are guaranteed that the part will work as a replacement. You also will have confidence that the part is of the same quality as the part you are replacing.

- If the display on your older notebook often dims or goes blank, it is probably an indication that your LCD screen is using a CCFL inverter to backlight the LCD display. The CCFL inverter needs to be replaced. 
   Replacing the inverter is much less expensive than replacing the LCD display.

- In-plane switching (IPS) has a high response rate. This is your best choice for touchscreen displays.
        - Twisted nematic (TN) was used in early LCD displays to enable a display with batteries. This technology is not used with touchscreen displays.
        - Vertical alignment (VA) was an early adoption of color LCD. While it produces a truer black and offers a wider viewing angle, it suffers from distortion when transitioning colors and is not used for touchscreen displays.
        - A touch screen digitizer (TSD) is not an LCD display technology. It is used if a touchscreen is not embedded into the display during manufacturing. A TSD is a thin glass digitizer that is placed in front of the display to read touch events.   

- Vertical alignment (VA) produces a truer black and offers a wider viewing angle. However, this type of LCD display often suffers from distortion when transitioning colors.
        - Twisted nematic (TN) was used in early LCD displays. TN displays used low operating voltages, making their use with batteries possible. They are still used for monochrome alphanumeric displays and do not distort images.
        - IPS (in-plane switching) has a high response rate and is used in LCD displays, as this technology does not distort images when changing colors. IPS is the best choice for use on touchscreen displays.
        - Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) is a display technology that is gradually replacing LCD. OLED is not an LCD technology.

- Hibernate saves the RAM contents to a hibernation file. All other components are turned off. When the computer is restarted, the loader reads the hibernation file and jumps to the system's previous, pre-hibernation location.
        - Working means the computer is running and is usable.
        - Standby means that RAM is fully powered on, but screen and storages devices are powered down. This allows the system to quickly change to the Working state.
        - Off means the system is completely turned off and is not consuming any power. No information from RAM is saved.

- Hibernate saves the state of your computer to the hard disk and completely powers off your computer. When the devices resumes, the saved state is restored to RAM, and you can pick up where you left off.        

- The computer must have sufficient disk space to save the contents of RAM to a hibernation file on your internal hard disk.

- The most likely cause of your power issue is that you were given the wrong adapter for the laptop. Most adapters are not interchangeable between laptops, as they require varying amounts of voltage and amperage. Even if the plug for the
    laptop is the correct size, the adapter may not be generating sufficient power to charge the laptop battery.

- Hibernation saves everything in RAM to the hard drive. You need at least as much free disk space as you have RAM.

- The best description provided is that a USB device stops providing power to a port when a USB device is not in use.

- Nickel Cadmium (NiCad) batteries take up the most space, while Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries take up the least space.
        - The most expensive of the Nickel-based batteries is Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH).
        - Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries cannot be overcharged, but they also suffer from swelling and catching fire.

- Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries offer the greatest storage capacity in the smallest amount of space.

- Lithium Ion batteries suffer from swelling and eventually catching fire. Should the battery swell, stop using your device and replace the battery.

- Capacitive touchscreens provide multi-touch or gestures, which allow a tablet to recognize multiple finger touches at the same time.

- There are two technologies that mobile operating systems use to detect device movement. They are accelerometers and gyroscopes.

- Wearable devices are a type of mobile device meant to be worn somewhere on the body. These devices range from being as simple as a fitness tracker wristband to as complex as smart glasses or virtual reality headsets. 
   Most wearable devices are designed to interface with another device. For example, a smartwatch by itself has a limited set of functionality. It is designed to connect to smartphones using Bluetooth. This connection unlocks 
   additional functionality, such as reading texts or answering phones calls.

- A USB-C connector is normally used for connecting external devices, including displays and Ethernet adapters.

- Many smartphones can enable their hotspot feature. This feature allows you to turn your smartphone into a Wi-Fi host that allows other Wi-Fi-enabled devices to connect and use your smartphone's internet connection.

- At home or in the office, you may want a desktop experience with a full-sized keyboard, mouse, and multiple displays. You may also want to connect multiple wired devices. A docking station maintains these permanent connections
  and provides a dock for the laptop, making it the easiest and most effective way to provide the work experience you need.

- Mobile phones are now used with medical technology. Devices utilize Bluetooth or Wi-Fi technology to communicate with a fingertip EKG (fingertip electrocadiogram) or CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) for diabetic patients.

- A touch pen, or digital pen, is a specific type of pen that usually includes finer abilities, such as tilt and pressure sensitivity. A touch pen allows users to become more creative with their drawings and writing.

- Near Field Communication (NFC) chips are a wireless mobile technology that can be embedded in credit cards and smartphones for transmitting financial information when making payments. For example, many point-of-sale devices 
   can read information from NFC chips. NFC chips can also be used in passports. 

- Hotspot - a physical location where you can obtain wireless internet access using a wireless local area network (WLAN) over a router that is connected to an internet service provider.
    - Tethering - a means for connecting one device to another. In the context of mobile phones and tablet computers, tethering allows the sharing of the internet connection from a phone or tablet with other devices, like laptops.
    - Mobile VPN - a mechanism that provides mobile devices with access to network resources and software applications on their home network (when the devices connect using other wireless or wired networks).
    - NFC - a type of connector that is used to emulate cryptographic smart card functionalities for RFID tags or memory cards.
    - Bluetooth - a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances from fixed and mobile devices and for building personal area networks (PANs). Bluetooth can connect several devices, overcoming the problems of synchronization.   

- A lightning connection is used to connect an Apple mobile device to another device using a physical cable or by plugging the second device directly into the lightning connection. A credit card reader can be plugged into a lightning connection to make retail payments.

- A VPN (virtual private network) creates an encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. Sometimes called a tunnel, a VPN allows users to access corporate applications and resources.

- Mutual authentication is a security feature in which a client process must prove its identity to a server, and the server must prove its identity to the client before any application traffic is sent over the client-to-server connection.

- You can connect an iPad to a Windows 11 PC in the following three ways:
        - USB cable
        - Wi-Fi wireless connection
        - Bluetooth wireless connection

- You can configure the Mail app on an iPad to connect to any email server that is reachable over the network using the IMAP, POP3, and SMTP protocols. An iPad also supports server connections that are secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security. 
   An iPad can also connect to email accounts that are hosted by large service providers, such as Gmail.        

- S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a protocol that is used to encrypt emails. S/MIME allows the sender to digitally sign and encrypt emails. An encrypted email server encrypts emails between the server and an email client, but the encrypted 
   email server stores the emails in an unencrypted form. A proper certificate must be used to encrypt and decrypt S/MIME emails.   

- SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, can encrypt emails on a mobile device.

- A Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy addresses the issues of personal data privacy and corporate data protection. This policy also addresses corporate versus individual mobile device control.

- The features listed below help to improve the security of sensitive information on your mobile device if it is lost or stolen.
    -Remote wipe - Wipes your device to keep sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands.
    -Screen lock - Keeps casual users from gaining access to your device (determined hackers can find ways around a screen lock).
    -Locator applications - Assist in finding your device if you happen to misplace it.

- Internet of Things (IoT) devices utilize the internet or other communications networks to exchange data with other devices and systems. 
  Examples include smartwatches, smart fire alarms, smart door locks, smart bicycles, medical sensors, fitness trackers, and smart security systems.    

- The digital security method being used is multifactor authentication. Multifactor authentication is the process of authenticating a user by validating two or more claims, each from a different category. 
   Examples include a password and mobile phone possession or a password and a fingerprint.  

- An app that uses the phone camera without permission could be categorized as malware. A malware scan should detect this issue.

- Full device encryption is an effective security method for mobile devices that encrypts every single sector of the device's storage, regardless of whether it has data or not. This protects the entirety of the device, including deleted files.

- Apps that have been reviewed, approved, and signed with a certificate by the app service are referred to as trusted apps.
        - Apps that have not been reviewed, approved, or signed with a certificate by the app service are referred to as untrusted apps. Untrusted apps might be safe, but it is risky to install them, and most devices won't allow them to be installed by default.

- Many mobile devices, by default, are configured to access any wireless connection based on signal strength. Secure Wi-Fi connections request additional information to log in. For better security, disable automatic Wi-Fi connectivity on mobile devices.

- Weak or lost cellular signals can be an indication of malware, especially if the location's signal has been good in the past. The best action is to uninstall the new app and use anti-malware apps and app scanners to inspect for malware.

<h3>12.7.8 Laptop and Device Troubleshooting Quiz Facts</h3>
- The most likely cause of your dimness and flickering is a failing LCD screen inverter. The inverter is a small electronic component that is used to power the LCD backlight. If the inverter fails or is failing, the backlight may flicker or go off, similar to a fluorescent bulb.

- The first step in performing a manual calibration is to charge the battery to 100%. Because you might not be able to trust the power meter that shows in Windows, be sure to allow sufficient charging time.
    --Once the battery is charged to 100%, you then change the power settings so that the system does not shut down the laptop automatically. You follow this by unplugging the laptop and running the power down to a level below 3%.

- Most laptop batteries only last 1 to 3 years. When the batteries can't hold a charge for more than a few minutes, you can safely assume that it's time to replace the battery.

- The best first step would be to toggle the display setting with the fn key. Most laptops offer several display choices, such as PC screen only, Second screen only, Duplicate (both screens), and Extend (both screens). The most likely culprit in this scenario is that the display 
   has been toggled to PC screen only, so choosing either of the other two settings should allow the user to see the display on the projector.

- It is possible that the notebook's LCD cutoff switch is stuck in the Off position. The cutoff switch is used to shut off the backlight (and sometimes the video display itself) when the notebook lid is closed. Press and release the cutoff switch to determine if this is actually the problem.

- To fix this problem, you need to recalibrate the digitizer pad. Over time, digitizer pads on laptops can develop drift. You can fix this issue by running a recalibration program, which is usually included with the pad.

- Each running app consumes tablet resources, such as memory and CPU. Multiple apps contending for scarce resources may cause poor performance. All mobile devices provide the user the ability to either close all running apps or stop them selectively.

- The surest way to prevent the loss of important information on your mobile device is to configure your device to remotely back up important data to the cloud.
