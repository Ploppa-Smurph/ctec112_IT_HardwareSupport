<h3>13.1.10 Quiz Facts</h3>
- After you install a new printer for a customer, client, or user, the next steps to take are to configure device-specific settings and then print a test page to verify that the printer is working properly.

- Print driver - The software that allows the printer to communicate with the print device.
    -Printer port - The connection point for the print device to connect to a print server.
    -Print queue - The location on the hard disk that holds print jobs waiting to be processed.
    -Print server - The software process that sends print jobs to the print device.
    -Print spooler - The software process that captures print jobs from applications, places them in the print queue, and then sends each print job to the print device.

- Escape codes were used by early printers. Hewlett-Packard's Printer Control Language (PCL) and Adobe PostScript are two common printer languages for modern printers.

- The print queue is the portion of the hard drive where print jobs are stored before going to the print device.

- The print spooler is an executable file that runs as a service on Windows to manage the printing process.

- you can't delete the print job because you don't have the Manage documents permission. Users who have the Manage documents permission can manage all documents in the queue (pause, resume, delete, or rearrange the order).

- Users with the Manage this printer permission can pause the printer and edit the printer properties, but cannot manage any documents waiting to be printed.

- employees can use the Printer Properties feature to edit the printer properties and to configure custom settings for the specific print device.

- View Printer Properties to see all the drivers that a printer uses. You can also use Printer Properties to view the port that a printer uses, manage user permissions, and configure color management profiles.

- Use Print Server Properties or Printer Properties to view the port(s) that a printer uses. Print Server Properties displays the printer port(s) that a system uses. Printer Properties displays the port(s) for the individual printer as well as all printer ports for the system.
