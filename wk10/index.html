<h2>13.1 Printer Overview</h2>
<h3>13.1.1</h3>
<h3>13.1.10 Quiz Facts</h3>
- After you install a new printer for a customer, client, or user, the next steps to take are to configure device-specific settings and then print a test page to verify that the printer is working properly.

- Print driver - The software that allows the printer to communicate with the print device.
    -Printer port - The connection point for the print device to connect to a print server.
    -Print queue - The location on the hard disk that holds print jobs waiting to be processed.
    -Print server - The software process that sends print jobs to the print device.
    -Print spooler - The software process that captures print jobs from applications, places them in the print queue, and then sends each print job to the print device.

- Escape codes were used by early printers. Hewlett-Packard's Printer Control Language (PCL) and Adobe PostScript are two common printer languages for modern printers.

- The print queue is the portion of the hard drive where print jobs are stored before going to the print device.

- The print spooler is an executable file that runs as a service on Windows to manage the printing process.

- you can't delete the print job because you don't have the Manage documents permission. Users who have the Manage documents permission can manage all documents in the queue (pause, resume, delete, or rearrange the order).

- Users with the Manage this printer permission can pause the printer and edit the printer properties, but cannot manage any documents waiting to be printed.

- employees can use the Printer Properties feature to edit the printer properties and to configure custom settings for the specific print device.

- View Printer Properties to see all the drivers that a printer uses. You can also use Printer Properties to view the port that a printer uses, manage user permissions, and configure color management profiles.

- Use Print Server Properties or Printer Properties to view the port(s) that a printer uses. Print Server Properties displays the printer port(s) that a system uses. Printer Properties displays the port(s) for the individual printer as well as all printer ports for the system.
<h2>13.2 Print Connectivity</h2>
Ethernet printer-	A printer that uses a network interface card in the computer to attach to an Ethernet router or hub on the network. You can use an Ethernet network for one or more computers and support many printers and systems simultaneously.
Local printer-	A printer that requires a direct connection to a specific computer. A local printer can be connected by wire, wirelessly, or using Ethernet cable.
Network printer-	A printer that has a network interface card that directly connects it to the network hub or switch.
Shared printer- 	A printer that connects directly to a computer and is configured as shared on the network.
Scan-to-folder- 	A feature that makes it easy to share large volume files on a network.
Wireless printer-	A printer that communicates with wireless clients through radio frequency technologies such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Wireless technologies help users to share print resources around an office or building without running cables.

OCR software can:
    - Automatically apply image enhancement.
    - Extract metadata and indexing keys.
    - Route scanned direct documents to where they should go next.
    - Extract text from photos or hand-written notes.
    - Convert documents to machine-readable text.
    - Create digital files that are searchable, editable, sharable, and optimally stored.
<h3>13.2.8 Quiz Facts</h3>
- If a printer is not Wi-Fi-capable but it has an Ethernet port, connect the printer to a wireless router with an Ethernet cable. Users on the same network as the wireless router will be able to send jobs to the printer as if the printer had a wired connection.
      * (All users will have to install that printer's driver on their workstations.)

- Connecting a printer to a network lets multiple users print to the same printer.

- There are two common ways to make a printer a network printer. Most printers come with an integrated network card or have a slot for adding a network card. Otherwise, it is possible to connect to the network using an external printer server. 
  The external print server functions as a gateway between the printer's parallel interface and the network topology.

- A hotspot is a term used to describe an area where users have internet access through an unrestricted Wi-Fi connection.

- A local printer is connected directly to a specific computer.
    - A network printer is connected to the network router or switch.
    - A shared printer is connected to a computer and then configured through network sharing.
    - A web-enabled printer is connected to the network remotely using the internet. 

- When you install the proper printer drivers on the print server, they are automatically downloaded and configured for the client whenever you add a printer.

- Cloud services most closely match your requirements, as the digitized documents will be stored offsite will be available from a centralized storage location and will provide for mobility and collaboration in real time.

- A flatbed scanner is specifically designed to manually scan bulky items, such as pages in a book or large-sized documents.

- Scan-to-email network document scanning supports SSL encryption, which provides a more secure transmission than the scan-to-folder method.

- Server Message Block (SMB) provides the following functionality with the scan-to-folder method. SMB:
    - Enables file, print, scan, and device sharing.
    - Provides client-server network communication.    
<h2>13.3 Printer Types and Components</h2>
Calibration- 	A process to improve print quality. Modern printers commonly have calibration programs to electronically perform adjustments, but changes to the settings may be done manually.
Carriage-	An assembly that carries the printhead(s) back and forth with precise, controlled movement while printing.
Cartridge-	A reservoir that carries ink or toner and is the main consumable component in a printer.
Duplexing assembly- 	An optional printer attachment that automatically turns over paper and reroutes it back through the printer for two-sided printing.
Extruder- 	On a 3-D printer, a simple extruder assembly includes stepper motor, nozzle and heater.
Platen roller- 	The platen roller moves material through the printer. It is made of rubber to grab and push the paper.
Print bed- 	The surface of a 3-D printer where the filament is deposited for building an object.
Printhead- 	The component in the printer that transfers ink to paper. Different printers may use different types of printheads. The printhead is usually mounted on the carriage assembly that moves back and forth.

<h3>13.3.11 Quiz Facts</h3>
- Laser printers use a laser to charge a metal drum. The drum picks up plastic toner, and the toner is then fused onto the paper (using rollers and heat). 
    - Dot matrix printers use an inked ribbon. The printing mechanism strikes the ribbon to put ink onto the paper. 
    - A dye sublimation printer is a non-impact printer that uses film-embedded dye. 
    - Inkjet printers are quiet non-impact printers that store ink in a reservoir.

- The primary corona (also called the main corona or the charge corona) prepares the photosensitive drum for writing by causing the drum to receive a negative electrostatic charge. Depending on the printer, the primary corona is either wires or rollers.

- Although laser printers might cost more to purchase, in the long run, the cost to print black-and-white text (with occasional graphics) is less per page than with an Inkjet printer.

- Calibration ensures that the printhead and paper are properly aligned so that printouts are aligned and clear, avoiding fuzzy lines or colored areas that sometimes start and stop before they should.

- The carriage assembly carries the printhead and ink cartridges back and forth with precise, controlled movement during a print job.

- Thermal printer technology is simple. The feed assembly is a rubber roller, or platen, that grabs the paper and passes it through the printer. A spring device applies pressure to the paper so that the paper always touches the printhead as it passes through.

- The only printer that can handle multi-part forms using carbonless or carbon paper is an impact printer, as the printhead physically strikes the surface.

- The hitting action of the printhead on the paper is the reason that impact printers are noisy.

- An electromagnet converts the impulses into physical movements, causing small hammers to appropriately strike the printhead.

- The best solution for Jeremy's issues is to use a heated build bed. Using a heated bed helps control the cooling process and prevents issues like poor adhesion to the bed, poor adhesion between layers, and warping from uneven or early cooling.
