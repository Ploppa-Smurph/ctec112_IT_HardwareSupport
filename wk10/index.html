<h2>13.1 Printer Overview</h2>
<h3>13.1.1</h3>
<h3>13.1.10 Quiz Facts</h3>
- After you install a new printer for a customer, client, or user, the next steps to take are to configure device-specific settings and then print a test page to verify that the printer is working properly.

- Print driver - The software that allows the printer to communicate with the print device.
    -Printer port - The connection point for the print device to connect to a print server.
    -Print queue - The location on the hard disk that holds print jobs waiting to be processed.
    -Print server - The software process that sends print jobs to the print device.
    -Print spooler - The software process that captures print jobs from applications, places them in the print queue, and then sends each print job to the print device.

- Escape codes were used by early printers. Hewlett-Packard's Printer Control Language (PCL) and Adobe PostScript are two common printer languages for modern printers.

- The print queue is the portion of the hard drive where print jobs are stored before going to the print device.

- The print spooler is an executable file that runs as a service on Windows to manage the printing process.

- you can't delete the print job because you don't have the Manage documents permission. Users who have the Manage documents permission can manage all documents in the queue (pause, resume, delete, or rearrange the order).

- Users with the Manage this printer permission can pause the printer and edit the printer properties, but cannot manage any documents waiting to be printed.

- employees can use the Printer Properties feature to edit the printer properties and to configure custom settings for the specific print device.

- View Printer Properties to see all the drivers that a printer uses. You can also use Printer Properties to view the port that a printer uses, manage user permissions, and configure color management profiles.

- Use Print Server Properties or Printer Properties to view the port(s) that a printer uses. Print Server Properties displays the printer port(s) that a system uses. Printer Properties displays the port(s) for the individual printer as well as all printer ports for the system.
<h2>13.2 Print Connectivity</h2>
Ethernet printer-	A printer that uses a network interface card in the computer to attach to an Ethernet router or hub on the network. You can use an Ethernet network for one or more computers and support many printers and systems simultaneously.
Local printer-	A printer that requires a direct connection to a specific computer. A local printer can be connected by wire, wirelessly, or using Ethernet cable.
Network printer-	A printer that has a network interface card that directly connects it to the network hub or switch.
Shared printer- 	A printer that connects directly to a computer and is configured as shared on the network.
Scan-to-folder- 	A feature that makes it easy to share large volume files on a network.
Wireless printer-	A printer that communicates with wireless clients through radio frequency technologies such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Wireless technologies help users to share print resources around an office or building without running cables.

OCR software can:
    - Automatically apply image enhancement.
    - Extract metadata and indexing keys.
    - Route scanned direct documents to where they should go next.
    - Extract text from photos or hand-written notes.
    - Convert documents to machine-readable text.
    - Create digital files that are searchable, editable, sharable, and optimally stored.
<h3>13.2.8 Quiz Facts</h3>
- If a printer is not Wi-Fi-capable but it has an Ethernet port, connect the printer to a wireless router with an Ethernet cable. Users on the same network as the wireless router will be able to send jobs to the printer as if the printer had a wired connection.
      * (All users will have to install that printer's driver on their workstations.)

- Connecting a printer to a network lets multiple users print to the same printer.

- There are two common ways to make a printer a network printer. Most printers come with an integrated network card or have a slot for adding a network card. Otherwise, it is possible to connect to the network using an external printer server. 
  The external print server functions as a gateway between the printer's parallel interface and the network topology.

- A hotspot is a term used to describe an area where users have internet access through an unrestricted Wi-Fi connection.

- A local printer is connected directly to a specific computer.
    - A network printer is connected to the network router or switch.
    - A shared printer is connected to a computer and then configured through network sharing.
    - A web-enabled printer is connected to the network remotely using the internet. 

- When you install the proper printer drivers on the print server, they are automatically downloaded and configured for the client whenever you add a printer.

- Cloud services most closely match your requirements, as the digitized documents will be stored offsite will be available from a centralized storage location and will provide for mobility and collaboration in real time.

- A flatbed scanner is specifically designed to manually scan bulky items, such as pages in a book or large-sized documents.

- Scan-to-email network document scanning supports SSL encryption, which provides a more secure transmission than the scan-to-folder method.

- Server Message Block (SMB) provides the following functionality with the scan-to-folder method. SMB:
    - Enables file, print, scan, and device sharing.
    - Provides client-server network communication.    
<h2>13.3 Printer Types and Components</h2>
Calibration- 	A process to improve print quality. Modern printers commonly have calibration programs to electronically perform adjustments, but changes to the settings may be done manually.
Carriage-	An assembly that carries the printhead(s) back and forth with precise, controlled movement while printing.
Cartridge-	A reservoir that carries ink or toner and is the main consumable component in a printer.
Duplexing assembly- 	An optional printer attachment that automatically turns over paper and reroutes it back through the printer for two-sided printing.
Extruder- 	On a 3-D printer, a simple extruder assembly includes stepper motor, nozzle and heater.
Platen roller- 	The platen roller moves material through the printer. It is made of rubber to grab and push the paper.
Print bed- 	The surface of a 3-D printer where the filament is deposited for building an object.
Printhead- 	The component in the printer that transfers ink to paper. Different printers may use different types of printheads. The printhead is usually mounted on the carriage assembly that moves back and forth.

<h3>13.3.11 Quiz Facts</h3>
- Laser printers use a laser to charge a metal drum. The drum picks up plastic toner, and the toner is then fused onto the paper (using rollers and heat). 
    - Dot matrix printers use an inked ribbon. The printing mechanism strikes the ribbon to put ink onto the paper. 
    - A dye sublimation printer is a non-impact printer that uses film-embedded dye. 
    - Inkjet printers are quiet non-impact printers that store ink in a reservoir.

- The primary corona (also called the main corona or the charge corona) prepares the photosensitive drum for writing by causing the drum to receive a negative electrostatic charge. Depending on the printer, the primary corona is either wires or rollers.

- Although laser printers might cost more to purchase, in the long run, the cost to print black-and-white text (with occasional graphics) is less per page than with an Inkjet printer.

- Calibration ensures that the printhead and paper are properly aligned so that printouts are aligned and clear, avoiding fuzzy lines or colored areas that sometimes start and stop before they should.

- The carriage assembly carries the printhead and ink cartridges back and forth with precise, controlled movement during a print job.

- Thermal printer technology is simple. The feed assembly is a rubber roller, or platen, that grabs the paper and passes it through the printer. A spring device applies pressure to the paper so that the paper always touches the printhead as it passes through.

- The only printer that can handle multi-part forms using carbonless or carbon paper is an impact printer, as the printhead physically strikes the surface.

- The hitting action of the printhead on the paper is the reason that impact printers are noisy.

- An electromagnet converts the impulses into physical movements, causing small hammers to appropriately strike the printhead.

- The best solution for Jeremy's issues is to use a heated build bed. Using a heated bed helps control the cooling process and prevents issues like poor adhesion to the bed, poor adhesion between layers, and warping from uneven or early cooling. 
<h2>13.4 Printer Troubleshooting</h2>
Paper feeder-	A device that feeds paper into a printer. Single-cut sheets are fed automatically from a tray in the printer or fed by hand into a paper feeder.
Paper rollers-	The cylindrical devices that tightly pinch the paper and move it through the printing process. A stepper motor advances the rollers.
Print Device-	The physical, peripheral device connected to a computer. The print device is where the printed page output happens.
Print preferences-	 Printing preferences are settings such as orientation, page order, and paper source. You can also set preferences for options supported by a printer such as collating or stapling.
Orientation-	The way the document is positioned on the paper. In portrait orientation, the long edge of the paper is vertical. In landscape orientation, the long edge of the paper is horizonal.
<h3>13.4.1</h3>
<h3>13.4.4 Quiz Facts</h3>
- If a corona wire is dirty, it might not create a uniform charge. As a result, the toner might not be attracted correctly to the photosensitive drum or paper. A vertical stripe is a typical symptom of this problem. Be careful when cleaning a corona wire because they are delicate.

- Because the fuser rollers heat and press the entire paper, dirty fuser rollers are the most likely problem.

- the issue described in this question is the result of a bad or incorrect printer driver. When Hannah moved and created a connection to her new printer, she selected the wrong printer driver.

- If only part of a page is printed on a laser printer (and the rest of the page is blank), you most likely need to add memory in the printer. This is especially true if it happens when complex graphical documents are printed, but printing works correctly with text-only documents.

- You should download and install the latest printer driver and then use the Color Management tab to adjust the driver's color settings. Many times, installing the latest driver alone will fix color issues. If not, you can manually adjust the color settings until they match the original settings.

- When paper gets jammed, you should first power the printer off and then locate where the paper is. Gently pull the paper in the same direction it would have traveled had it not become jammed. This is critical because most printer components are designed to follow a certain path when in operation. 
   When they get stuck, it is better for them to complete whatever cycle they were on. Going against the pathway of the paper may cause these components to backtrack as well, which is not recommended. The other reason for following the paper path is that going against the normal pathway may result 
   in tearing the paper. If a stuck sheet tears, it is that much harder for you to deal with the problem, as you may need to open certain modules to access the torn paper bits.

- Aubrey is most likely printing on pre-printed paper, whereas the images are not using laser printer-compatible ink. This causes the heat and pressure to transfer the pre-printed image to the drum during the fusing process and then replicate the images on the printed pages.

- Ghost images within 2 to 3 cm of the original image are an indication that the ghosting is caused by the imaging drum. When a drum unit comes to the end of its useable life cycle, it may not discharge properly, leaving behind faint traces of the previous print job. An imaging drum can also 
   become defective and discharge incorrectly between print runs, causing ghosting to occur. In either case, the best solution it to replace the imaging drum.

- After the toner has been applied to the paper, the paper passes through two heated rollers known as the fuser, or fuser unit. The heat and pressure from the rollers fuse the toner particles into the fibers on the paper. If the toner on the finished printed paper is smudging, 
    the most likely issue is that the fuser unit is malfunctioning in some way.   

- When you print a test page from your computer and it does not work properly, you most likely have an incorrect printer driver or a printer cable that is not fastened properly.
