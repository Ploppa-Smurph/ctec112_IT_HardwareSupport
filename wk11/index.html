<h3>14.8.7 Quiz Facts</h3>
- ACLs (access control lists) are sets of rules used by firewalls. They specify which types of network traffic are allowed through the firewall. Any traffic that does not match the rules are blocked.

- The Firewall & security settings let you configure which applications have access in and out of your computer by means of the internet. This helps to protect your computer, your data, and even your 
   identity. Since the application had access at home (a private network) and at the office (a domain network), but not in the hotel (a guest or public network), the most likely scenario is that this 
   application is being blocked by the firewall's Public network settings under Firewall & security settings.

- A circuit-layer gateway scans network traffic based on TCP or UDP transmission. If the transmission is detected as legitimate, the packet is granted access while the link remains established.

- A firewall filters network traffic based on a set of rules (ACL). The network administrator most likely needs to configure the company's network firewall to allow RDP traffic.

- Firewalls limit traffic by blocking connections that are initiated from an untrusted network, such as the internet, unless the traffic matches rules you configure in the firewall's access control list (ACL).

- You need to open the firewall port for the Remote Desktop program. Firewalls prevent all traffic except authorized traffic. To allow a specific program, open the port that corresponds to the port used by that application.

- Firewalls often filter packets by checking each packet against a set of administrator-defined criteria. If the packet is not accepted, it is simply dropped.

- An endpoint management server is a way to keep track of various devices while ensuring that software is secure. Many companies that need small IT department overhead use this option.

- The network criteria specified by your client requires several different network devices to be implemented, including a firewall, an email scanner, a content filter, and an intrusion prevention system. The most cost-effective
   way to best meet your client's criteria would be an all-in-one UTM security appliance.

- Intrusion detection detects intrusions and alerts the network. However, it does not block traffic.
    * Intrusion protection detects and blocks network traffic that is not recognized by its profile.
    * Anti-spam is designed to detect and block certain types of email.
    * A VPN encrypts traffic over a secure network. However, a VPN does not block traffic.
